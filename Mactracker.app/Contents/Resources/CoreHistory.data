			<string>Aside from bug fixes left over from 3.2 and 3.3, there wasn't much of a change in System 4.0. It did have some fixes to accommodate AppleShare, like a new Chooser and a new Control Panel with an AppleTalk section. System 4.0 was recommended for all Macs with 512 KB of RAM and higher, which means only the Macintosh 512K and above were able to run it. System 4.1 was released the following month newly adapted for AppleShare 1.1. AppleShare 1.1 was needed to network the newly released Mac II, and an updated version of the Mac OS was needed to accommodate it. Another update due to new technology was the way the Finder handled large capacity drives (namely those larger than 32 MB). This System also excluded a model, the Macintosh 512K, since you needed 1 MB of RAM to run it.</string>

			<string>In 1990, Apple decided to offer entry-level LaserWriter printers and released the Personal LaserWriter series. The Personal LaserWriter series was targeted at home computer users or small businesses. They were of lower quality but therefore rather inexpensive. Apple shipped the first Personal LaserWriter (Personal LaserWriter SC) without a CPU, but later models shipped with AMD processors. Later the Personal LaserWriter series even supported LocalTalk networking, it never supported ethernet networking, though.</string>

			<string>HomePod was first announced on June 5, 2017, at the Worldwide Developers Conference. On January 23, 2018, Apple announced that the HomePod will be available for preorders on January 26 and will arrive on February 9. A touchscreen atop the device displays a dynamic waveform, similar to the one displayed on other Apple devices when Siri is activated. It also allows the user to adjust playback volume and to play and pause playback. It features seven tweeters in its base and a four-inch woofer towards the top. Six microphones around HomePod’s centre gauge the acoustics of the room; software directs parts of the mix to various speakers for improved sound quality and separation. The HomePod supports AirPlay 2, which allows multi-speaker audio streaming. It uses the Apple A8 chip and the Siri software.</string>

			<string>iPhone X (pronounced "ten") was announced on September 12, 2017, alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus. The phone was released on November 3, 2017. The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch (diagonal) OLED color-accurate screen that supports DCI-P3 wide color gamut, sRGB, and high dynamic range. This "Super Retina HD Display" has the True Tone technology found on the iPad Pro, which uses six-channel ambient light sensors to adapt the display's white balance to the surrounding ambient light. The iPhone X has two color options, Silver and Space Gray. The front and back of the phone are composed of surgical-grade stainless steel to improve durability. The back has a glass slab over the aluminum to enable wireless charging. The design is intended to be IP67 water and dust resistant. Face ID replaces the Touch ID system. The facial recognition sensor consists of two parts: a "Romeo" module that projects more than 30,000 infrared dots onto the user's face, and a "Juliet" module that reads the pattern. The pattern is sent to the secure enclave in the A11 Bionic chip (which contains a dedicated AI accelerator) to confirm a match with the phone's owner's face. The home button, which made its debut on the original iPhone, has been removed from iPhone X and most of its functions replaced with gestures.</string>

			<string>Introduced in July 2015, the iPod touch (6th Generation) was the first update to the iPod touch line in nearly three years, and differed very little from the iPod touch (5th Generation); while the colors were different, and the "touch loop" wrist strap was gone, the case design was in other respects identical. Under the hood, however, the iPod touch (6th Generation) represented a significant upgrade. Most notable was the inclusion of an A8 processor, the same found in the iPhone 6, which finally brought 64-bit computing to the entirety of the iOS product line. It also included more RAM, faster graphics processing, an M8 motion co-processor, improved cameras, faster Wi-fi and upgraded Bluetooth support. The iPod touch (6th Generation) sold in six colors (blue, pink, silver, gold, slate, and (PRODUCT) RED), in four price tiers, based on storage capacity.</string>

			<string>Apple Watch Series 3 was introduced on September 12, 2017, and was released alongside the iPhone 8 on September 22, 2017. The main new feature is built-in LTE cellular connectivity and offers both voice and data communication, including out-of-the-box Apple Music streaming. Antenna functionality (receiving and transmitting elements for LTE and UMTS) is part of the display and the watch features an electronic SIM (eSIM), 1% the size of a standard SIM card, and shares the same mobile number as the user's iPhone. Apple claims 18 hours of battery life. It has a dual-core Apple S3 processor, which Apple claims is 70% faster than the S2. The cellular-capable watch has a red digital crown but the Series 3 device is also available in a non-LTE version. Siri is able to speak on Apple Watch Series 3 due to the increased processing speed of the Watch. On launch, GPS + Cellular models were available in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</string>

			<string>iOS 11 was announced and the first beta version released to developers at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 5, 2017, with a public beta released in late June, and a stable version for consumers was released in most countries on September 19, 2017. Among iOS 11's changes: a lock screen and Notification Center are combined, allowing all notifications to be displayed directly on the lock screen. The various pages of the Control Center are unified, gaining custom settings and the ability to 3D Touch icons for more options. The App Store receives a visual overhaul to focus on editorial content and daily highlights. A "Files" file manager app allows direct access to files stored locally and in cloud services. Siri can now translate between languages and use a privacy-minded "on-device learning" technique to better understand a user's interests and offer suggestions. The camera has new settings for improved portrait-mode photos and will use new encoding technologies to reduce file sizes on newer devices. Messages is integrated with iCloud to better synchronize messages across iOS and macOS devices; a later point release will support person-to-person Apple Pay payments. The operating system also introduces the ability to record the screen, drag-and-drop functionality, and support for augmented reality. Certain new features will appear only on iPad, including an always-accessible application dock, drag and drop and a new interface to show multiple apps at once. 32-bit–only apps are not supported or shown in the App Store in iOS 11, and users who attempt to open such apps receive an alert about the app's incompatibility.</string>

			<string>macOS High Sierra (version 10.13) is the fourteenth major release of macOS. The successor to macOS Sierra, it was announced at WWDC 2017 on June 5, 2017. The name "High Sierra" refers to the High Sierra region in California. As with Snow Leopard, Mountain Lion and El Capitan, the name also alludes to its status as a refinement of its predecessor, focused on performance improvements and technical updates rather than user features. Among the apps with notable changes are Photos and Safari. Apple File System (APFS) replaces HFS Plus as the default file system in macOS. It supports 64‑bit inode numbers, is designed for flash technology, and is designed to make common tasks like duplicating a file and finding the size of a folder’s contents faster. It also has built‑in encryption, crash‑safe protections, and simplified data backup on the go. macOS High Sierra adds support for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), with hardware acceleration where available, as well as support for High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF). Safari has a new "Intelligent Tracking Prevention" feature which uses machine learning to block third parties from tracking the user's actions. Safari can also block autoplaying videos from playing.</string>

			<string>During a press event held on October 27, 2016, at the company's headquarters, Apple announced new fourth-generation 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pro models. The models introduce the Touch Bar, a multi-touch enabled OLED strip built into the top of the keyboard, replacing the function keys. They also include a sapphire-glass covered Touch ID sensor at the right end of the Touch Bar. The enclosure continues to be an all-metal unibody construction with significant reduction in volume and weight. All ports have been replaced with either two or four Thunderbolt 3 ports, any of which can be used for charging, and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The models also introduce a "second-generation" butterfly mechanism keyboard similar to that of the Retina MacBook. The fourth generation 13-inch model has a trackpad that is 46% larger than its predecessor while the 15-inch model has a trackpad twice as large as the previous iteration. Speakers grilles are relocated to both sides of the keyboard on the 13-inch variant. Other updates to the new MacBook Pro include faster sixth-generation "Skylake" dual- and quad-core Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, improved graphics (Radeon Pro 450, 455 and optional 460 available on 15-inch models), and displays that offer a 25% wider color gamut, 67% more brightness, and 67% more contrast. Apple also introduced a new lower-end 13-inch model which lacks the Touch Bar in favor of function keys and has only two Thunderbolt 3 ports.</string>

			<string>The Apple Hard Disk 20SC was Apple's first SCSI based hard drive for the Apple II family as well as the Macintosh. The case design would be reused unchanged (in Platinum only) for 2 more models introduced the following year: 40SC and 80SC. In addition to being the first cross-platform drive offered by Apple it was the first hard drive to use the Snow White design language. Notably, it was the only Snow White product to use the Macintosh beige color and one of the few Apple products to be introduced in two different colors at the same time. Since the Apple IIGS was the first Apple product to debut in the new gray color they called Platinum, the 20SC had to both match it and the beige color of the Macintosh Plus, which it is designed to sit perfectly beneath. In 1987, all Apple products would change to Platinum, which would remain in use for the next 10 years.</string>

			<string>The ProFile was Apple's first hard drive. It was introduced in September 1981 at a price of $3,499 U.S., initially for use with the Apple III. The original model had a formatted capacity of 5 MB and connected to a special interface card that plugged into an Apple III slot. In 1983 Apple offered a ProFile interface card for the Apple II, with software support for Apple ProDOS and Apple Pascal. Also in 1983, Apple introduced the Lisa computer, which was normally sold with a ProFile. The ProFile could be connected to the built-in parallel port of the Lisa, or to a port of an optional dual-port parallel interface card. Up to three such interface cards could be installed, so in principle up to seven ProFile drives could be used on a Lisa. Later a 10 MB model was offered, but required an upgraded PROM/interface card to recognize the additional 5 MB.</string>

			<string>The Macintosh Hard Disk 20 was the first hard drive developed by Apple specifically for use with the Macintosh 512K. Introduced on September 17, 1985, it was part of Apple's long awaited solution toward completing the Macintosh Office (a suite of integrated business hardware and software) announced in January 1985. At the time when the average file size was around 10-20 kB and due to the vast number of those files the HD 20 could contain, Apple's original Macintosh File System, which did not allow for directories, would have made organizing those files unwieldy. Therefore, Apple introduced it with a new System and Finder update which included the brand new Hierarchical File System allowing the user to better organize files on such a large volume. As a result, only the Macintosh 512K could access it; the original Macintosh 128K did not have enough RAM to load the new file system. Most of the hard drives which were available on the market used the slower serial port to transfer data per Apple's specifications. Apple instead engineered the HD 20 to use the faster floppy disk port, enabling the user to daisy-chain an external floppy disk drive as well as an additional HD 20.</string>

			<string>On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the fourth generation Apple TV. It is the first major update to the platform since the release of the second generation Apple TV on September 1, 2010. Tim Cook took the stage and said "The future of TV is apps". He also stated that the Apple TV needed a modern OS. While following the form factor of the previous 2nd and 3rd generation models, it is slightly taller in size. Featuring a new touch remote allowing swipe-to-select functionality instead of the old remote's arrow button, with integrated Siri support, and motion sensor. The Siri button on the remote allows several functions, including searching across providers for content, accessing additional metadata, and video/audio controls. The 4th generation also uses a new operating system, tvOS, with an associated app store allowing download of third-party apps for video, audio, games, and other content – initially from a limited range of providers on release, with others able to release further apps using new APIs allowing them to do so. A requirement of these apps and games is that they all must include interfacing with the new touchpad-enabled Siri remote. Craig Federighi said that tvOS is 95% based on iOS 9 with the interface and APIs being tweaked to support the big screen.</string>

			<string>The iPhone 7 is similar in design to the iPhone 6s, though with a "mirrored" finish. Alongside the existing Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold colors, the device is offered in new Black and "Jet Black" colors. The "Jet Black" color is a darker shade with a high-gloss finish; it is created through a multi-step process, beginning with an anodization phase to make the surface of the casing a porous aluminum oxide, and then using a machine to "wipe" the casing through a powdered compound, absorbed by the aluminum oxide. The process is concluded with an "ultra-fine particle bath" for additional finishing; the entire process takes less than an hour. The iPhone 7 no longer uses a physical home button; it instead uses a touch-sensitive button with haptic feedback via Apple Taptic Engine. The button is also pressure-sensitive. The iPhone 7 does not feature a 3.5 mm headphone jack; it was replaced by a second speaker grill. A Lightning to 3.5mm connector adapter, as well as in-ear headphones that use a Lightning connector, are bundled with the device. The iPhone 7 is also water and dust resistant. The iPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion system-on-chip, which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores. The A10 also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of "console-level gaming". As with prior models, the iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7-inch screen, and a "Plus" variant with a 5.5-inch screen. The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to the 6s (720p and 1080p), but with an increased color gamut and brightness. Both device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor, the M10. Unlike previous iPhone models, internal storage options for the iPhone 7 begin at 32 GB instead of 16 GB. The iPhone 7 includes a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with a quad-LED "True Tone" flash; its aperture was widened to f/1.8 while the standard-size model adds optical image stabilization—a feature that was previously exclusive to the Plus models. The iPhone 7 Plus also includes a second 12-megapixel telephoto lens, which can be used to achieve 2x optical zoom, and up to 10x digital zoom. The front-facing camera was also upgraded to a 7-megapixel sensor.</string>

			<string>The Apple Pencil is a digital pen that works as an input device for iPad Pro. The Apple Pencil features pressure sensitivity and angle detection. Encased in a plastic housing is a Bluetooth device that can communicate simultaneously with the screen and the system underneath it. The Pencil can detect force, allowing, for example, darker or lighter strokes in a drawing app depending on how hard the user presses. The Apple Pencil was designed for low latency to enable smooth inking on the screen. The iPad Pro also allows simultaneous use of an Apple Pencil and one's fingers, while rejecting input from the user's palm. One end of the Apple Pencil has a magnetic removable cap. Underneath this cap is a Lightning connector, which allows the Pencil's battery to be recharged via the iPad Pro's Lightning port itself. The initial charge lasts about 12 hours, but 15 seconds plugged into the Lightning connector of the iPad Pro gets the user back to work for another half hour. The user can also use the included Lightning-to-Lightning adapter to charge via a standard Lightning cable instead.</string>

It features an app store, allowing third-party app developers to release their own apps on the platform. Also, this new software features support for Siri voice control. Craig Federighi mentioned that tvOS is based 95% on iOS 9 and the rest being adaptions to optimize it for the TV. The tvOS software development kit (SDK) for developing tvOS apps is included in the Xcode 7.1 and later. A new development feature, App Thinning, is being enforced on the new Apple TV, limiting the size of app downloads and steering users towards downloading individual segments of apps in order to better manage storage space.</string>

			<string>The successor to OS X El Capitan, it is the first version of the operating system issued under the June 2016 rebranding as macOS. Following the California landmark-based naming scheme introduced with OS X Mavericks, Sierra was named after California's Sierra Nevada mountain range. Sierra is the first version of macOS since OS X Mountain Lion, released in 2012, that does not run on all computers that the previous version supported. Siri will be integrated into the system. Users can access it via the Dock, the menu bar or a keyboard shortcut and results are shown with an interface in the upper-right corner. Siri can send messages, search the web, find files and adjust settings. Results are interactive and can be dropped into other applications or pinned to Notification Center. For instance, pictures from search results can be dragged into a document. The Photos application now has improved face recognition. It also features object and scene recognition. It groups similar pictures together using faces, locations and object recognition to create "memories". Memories contain picture slideshows with transitions and music selected by the algorithm, which can be modified to the user's liking. The People album organizes photos by the people in them, and Places shows all photos on a world map. Apple Pay allows vendors to embed an Apple Pay button in their online stores. In Safari, users can click the Apple Pay button to checkout, then securely complete purchases using an iPhone or Apple Watch. iCloud Drive has been more tightly integrated into the OS. Users can access all files from iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Windows PC and on iCloud.com. Optimized Storage can free up storage space. When storage space is low, it automatically uploads old files, photos, movies, and email attachments to iCloud and makes them available on demand. Files that are recently created and recent photos stay on the Mac to allow quick access. Optimized Storage also allows finding and removing files or apps. Applications that support multiple windows will support multiple tabs within a single window, allowing the user to keep windows organized similarly to Safari. When users approach their Mac while wearing an Apple Watch, they will automatically be logged in to their desktop account. The clipboard can be shared across nearby macOS Sierra and iOS 10 devices for cut, copy and paste.</string>

			<string>On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the new Siri Remote for the 4th generation Apple TV. It is a completely redesigned remote that features dual microphones for Siri support and a glass touch surface for navigation around the interface by swiping or tapping and scrubbing to fast forward or rewind. Also, it has a menu and home button, a Siri button to invoke Siri, a Play/ Pause button, and a Volume Up/Down button to control the volume on the TV. The Siri Remote will communicate with the Apple TV via Bluetooth rather than infrared, and thus doesn't require a line-of-sight with the device. This new remote is only supported by the 4th generation Apple TV and later; it will not work with earlier generations. The Siri Remote included with the Apple TV 4K features a white outline around the menu button.</string>

			<string>Released May 10, 1999 Mac OS 8.6 introduced the concept of a nanokernel to the Mac OS which allowed for multi-tasking and multi-processors. This nanokernel added a pre-emptive scheduler to Mac OS, but this is only allowed certain applications to run pre-emptively, all other applications that were not specifically developed to be pre-emptive were run in the blue task, a single pre-emptive task itself. This free update for Mac users running 8.5 and 8.5.1 was faster and much more stable than either versions of 8.5.x, and is by some considered the most stable Classic OS. It was the first client OS to support AFP over IP in addition to standard AppleTalk (this gave users the ability to access an iDisk even though it was unsupported by Apple). It was also the first Mac OS to have the OS version displayed as part of the startup screen. Many hardware upgrades require a minimum of Mac OS 8.6.</string>

			<string>iOS 9 was announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference 2015 on June 8, 2015, and was released on September 16, 2015. iOS 9 focuses less on new features and more on under-the-hood optimizations, as well as battery improvements. iOS 9 includes a new News app (replacing the Newsstand app) which displays news from sources such as The New York Times, CNN, Wired, and ESPN to bring one unified experience in the way users read, experience, and discover news. Apple Maps adds support for transit directions in Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York City, Paris, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Shanghai, Toronto, and Washington D.C., along with several other cities in China at launch, which will expand as Apple maps out more cities. iOS 9 also adds a number of features to the iPad to improve productivity. These include Slide Over, Split View, and Picture in Picture, for enhanced multitasking, similar to the experience found on OS X El Capitan. Intelligence is one of the main features in iOS 9, consisting of the newly integrated Siri and Search (previously known as Spotlight), as well as "proactivity" throughout the operating system. iOS is now more aware of contextual information (such as time and location), and proactively provides the user with what they may need in advance to save them time and effort. iOS 9 also includes many under-the-hood improvements such as improved performance with its Metal API, up to an hour more of battery life, improved security using advanced encryption and new 6-digit passcodes for Touch ID-enabled devices (increased from 4). Devices without Touch ID will also be able to use 4-digit passcodes, but it will not be the default option when adding a passcode to the device. A new Low Power Mode has been added, which is said to increase battery life by up to three hours. This feature is only available on iPhone. With the release of iOS 9, the Safari web browser allows for third-party integration.</string>

			<string>OS X El Capitan is the successor to OS X Yosemite and focuses mainly on performance, stability and security. Following the California landmark-based naming scheme introduced with OS X Mavericks, El Capitan was named after a rock formation in Yosemite National Park. OS X El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015, as a free upgrade through the Mac App Store. OS X El Capitan adds multi-touch gestures to applications like Mail and Messages that allow a user to delete or mark emails or conversations by swiping a finger on a multi-touch device, such as a trackpad. Apple Maps in El Capitan shows public transit information similar to Maps in iOS 9. This feature was limited to a handful of cities upon launch: Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York City, Paris, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Shanghai, Toronto and Washington D.C. The Notes application receives an overhaul, similar to Notes in iOS 9. Both applications have more powerful text-processing capabilities, such as to-do lists (like in the Reminders application), inline webpage previews, photos and videos, digital sketches, map locations and other documents and media types. Spotlight is improved with more contextual information such as the weather, stocks, news and sports scores. It is also able to process queries in natural language. OS X El Capitan has a new security feature called System Integrity Protection (SIP) that protects certain system processes, files and folders from being modified or tampered with by other processes even when executed by the root user or by a user with root privileges (sudo).</string>

			<string>The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were unveiled on September 9, 2015 during a press event named "Hey Siri, give us a hint." at the 7,000-seat Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. The hardware design of iPhone 6s is nearly identical to that of iPhone 6, although the chassis is now made of a stronger aluminum first used by the Apple Watch Sport to improve its rigidity. It is available in gold, silver, space gray, and new for the 6s, rose gold-color finishes. iPhone 6s is powered by the Apple A9 system on a chip, which the company stated is up to 70% faster than Apple A8, and has up to 90% better graphics performance. iPhone 6s has 2 GB of RAM, more than any previous iPhone, and also supports LTE Advanced. While the capacities of their batteries are slightly lower, Apple rates iPhone 6s and 6s Plus as having the same average battery life as their respective predecessors. The iPhone 6s features technology known as 3D Touch; sensors are embedded on the screen's backlight layer that measure the firmness of the user's touch input by the distance between it and the glass, allowing the device to distinguish between normal and more forceful touches. 3D Touch is combined with the Taptic Engine vibrator to provide associated haptic feedback. iPhone 6s features a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera, upgraded from the 8-megapixel unit on previous models, as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. It can also record 4K video, as well as 1080p video at 60 frames per second. The camera app's "Retina Flash" feature allows the display's brightness to be used as an impromptu flash on images taken with the front camera, while "Live Photos" captures a short video alongside each photo taken.</string>

			<string>Apple Watch was announced by Tim Cook on September 9, 2014. The Apple Watch incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities as well as integration with iOS and other Apple products and services. Apple announced the Apple Watch with three collections: Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport, and Apple Watch Edition. The watch will be distinguished by different combinations of cases and interchangeable bands. The watch relies on a connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions (e.g. calling and texting) and will be wirelessly compatible with the iPhone 5 or later models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Its screen is a pressure-sensitive touchscreen that can distinguish between a tap and a press, and features a digital crown, which can be turned to scroll or zoom and pressed to return to the home screen. The watch also has a button for displaying a list of contacts. The watch is charged by means of inductive charging, using a cable similar to the MagSafe cable from Apple's MacBook family of laptops. Apple designed a new typeface named San Francisco for the Apple Watch which Apple says is designed for legibility on the device's small display. The device was available for pre-order on April 10 and began shipping on April 24, 2015.</string>

It was first released on April 24, 2015, alongside the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch is currently the only device that runs watchOS. The API is called WatchKit. The home screen (rendered by and also known as "Carousel") is composed of circular application icons, which can be zoomed in and out with the Digital Crown. Glances provide fast access to a summarized view of the most popular native or third party applications used on Apple Watch. The glance view is opened with a swipe up gesture from the watch face screen. Navigation between widgets is achieved by swiping left or right. Different actions are executed depending on the force with which the user executes a tap, which Watch detects with a special mechanism.</string>

The bus speed on most models was raised to 166 MHz, and a PC-2100/2700 Double Data Rate SDRAM memory bus was included. Dual processors were included across the entire line, as were enhanced graphics cards. The G4 (MDD) was one of the loudest PowerMacs ever, and gained the nickname "G4 Windtunnel" for this reason (A fan and power supply replacement plan was subsequently offered by Apple). It shipped in three configurations: a dual 867 MHz model, with 256 MB of RAM, a 60 GB hard drive, a CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive, and a 32 MB NVIDIA GeForce4 MX graphics card was $1699 U.S.; dual 1 and 1.25 GHz models shipped with 256 and 512 MB of RAM, 80 and 120 GB hard drives, a DVD-R/CD-RW "SuperDrive" and an ATI Radeon 9000 Pro graphics card, for $2499 U.S. and $3299 U.S., respectively.</string>

			<string>On June 28, 2005, Apple Computer merged the iPod and iPod photo lines, removing all grayscale models from the main iPod line, giving the 20 GB iPod all of the capabilities of the former iPod photo line for $299 U.S., the same price as the previous grayscale version. The price of the 60 GB iPod photo, now known as iPod 60GB, dropped from $449 U.S. to $399 U.S., and Apple discontinued the $349 U.S. 30 GB iPod photo model. Apple Computer — as well as prominent fan sites (such as iLounge) — continued to refer to this lineup as fourth-generation iPods. Along with the new lineup, Apple also updated iTunes to version 4.9, which added podcasting capabilities to iTunes and to iPod.</string>

			<string>Originally, the Multiple Scan series covered both entry-level and professional displays. However, by 1995, Apple released the AppleVision series which was especially built for professional users. Therefore, Apple needed entry-level displays for their consumer customers. The Multiple Scan series became Apple's entry-level display series. All following Multiple Scan displays were equipped with cheaper Shadow Mask tubes that supported lower resolutions and less colors. The last Multiple Scan display, the Multiple Scan 720 display, was released in 1997.</string>

			<string>Announced in May 1998 and shipped in August, the iMac was Apple's computer for the new millennium. Aimed at the low-end consumer market and designed with the internet in mind, the iMac was positioned by Apple as the most original new computer since the original Mac in 1984, and came in a stylish new case design, with translucent "Bondi Blue" plastics. The iMac included a 4 Mbps IrDA port, and an internal 56Kbps modem (a 33.6 kbps modem was originally announced in May, but was upped to 56Kbps at MacWorld.), used two 12 Mbps Universal Serial Ports (USB) as its only means of external expansion, and included a newly-designed USB keyboard and mouse. While it had no other serial or SCSI ports, many manufacturers promised to make a variety of USB peripherals available by the time it shipped in August, and by and large they delivered on that promise. A "Rev B." model was released several months later, with 6 MB of VRAM, and several hardware bug-fixes. The iMac sold for $1,299 U.S. This Rev. B iMac was replaced by the Rev. C in January 1999.</string>

			<string>Mac OS 8 is a series of versions of the Mac OS that, although they introduced few remarkable new user features, supported a transition through major changes in the Apple Macintosh hardware platform. Its earliest release still supported "first generation" Macs with Motorola 680x0-family processors; its later releases ran on PowerPC G3 systems such as the early iMacs. It is most closely associated with the "second generation", "PowerPC"-labeled Macs that Apple sold in the interim. Version 8.0 was released on July 26, 1997. Improvements over System 7 include a multi-threaded Finder, the three-dimensional platinum appearance, and a number of performance related improvements to virtual memory, AppleScript execution times and system start-up times. Help was available in the form of an Info Center (by means of html pages stored on the user's hard drive, with links to the Internet), as well as previously used systems such as Balloon Help and Apple Guide.</string>

			<string>The Apple Monitor II is a CRT-based green monochrome 12-inch monitor manufactured for the Apple II family. Apple didn't manufacture the monitor until halfway through the lifespan of the II series. The business-line Apple III had its own Apple Monitor III long before. Many home users of Apple II computers used their televisions as computer monitors before the Monitor II was released. It featured an inner vertical-swivelling frame. This allowed users to adjust the viewing angle up or down to suit their taste without the addition of a tilt-and-swivel device. The Monitor II was widely adjustable for the time, as it included adjustments for the size and location of the image on the screen. These adjustments had a very small influence on the picture, however, much to the disliking of some users. The Monitor II was designed for the Apple II Plus, but was used widely throughout the Apple II product line, most recognizably on the Apple IIe.</string>

			<string>Introduced in March 2009, The Mac Pro (Early 2009) introduced Intel's Nehalem architecture to Apple's professional desktop line. Though the Intel Xeon 3500-series and 5500-series processors operated at lower clock rates than the 5400-series processors used in the Mac Pro (Early 2008), the system architecture provided more efficient caching and faster, point-to-point connections between the CPU and other system components, which resulted in a generally faster system, particularly for highly multi-threaded applications. The Mac Pro (Early 2009) came in two highly-customizable configurations. The Quad-Core model included a 4-core 2.66 GHz Intel Xeon 3500-series processor, 3 GB of RAM, a 640 GB 7200 RPM hard drive, and 512 MB of VRAM, for $2499 U.S. (a 2.93 processor and up to 16 GB of RAM were available as Built-to-order options). The 8-core model included two 4-core 2.26 GHz Intel Xeon 5500-series processors, 6 GB of RAM, a 640 GB 7200 RPM hard drive, and 512 MB of VRAM, for $3299 U.S. (2.66 and 2.93 GHz processors and up to 32 GB of RAM were available as built-to-order options). Built-to-order options for both models included up to 4 TB of storage (via four hard drive bays), up to three additional NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 graphics cards, an ATI Radeon HD 4870 graphics card, a second 18x SuperDrive, and RAID and Fibre Channel PCI Express cards.</string>

			<string>Macintosh XL was a modified version of the Apple Lisa personal computer. In the Macintosh XL configuration, the computer shipped with MacWorks XL, a Lisa program that allowed 64 K Macintosh ROM emulation. An identical machine was previously sold as the Lisa 2/10 with the Lisa OS only. The Macintosh XL had a 400K 3.5" floppy drive and an internal 10 MB proprietary Widget hard drive with provision for an optional 5 or 10 MB external ProFile hard drive with the addition of a Parallel interface card. The machine used a Motorola 68000 CPU, clocked at 5 MHz together with 512 KB RAM. Because of its roots as a Lisa — and unlike all other Macintosh computers — the Macintosh XL did not use square pixels. The resolution of the Macintosh XL was 720x364. Square pixels were available via a physical screen upgrade that changed the resolution to 608x431. The maximum upgraded RAM with conventional add-in cards was up to 2 MB - four times larger than the maximum capacity of earlier Macintosh computers.</string>

			<string>In October 2012, a new iMac model was introduced that featured a considerably smaller monitor depth than the previous models, measuring 5mm at its thinnest point. The 21.5" and 27" screens remained at their previous resolutions, 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 respectively. RAM has been upgraded; the standard specification is now 8 GB, with 16 GB being the optional maximum on the 21.5" model. Apple also upgraded the computers' processors, using Intel's Ivy Bridge microarchitecture-based Core i5 and Core i7. Video cards are now Nvidia as standard. USB 3.0 ports are now included for the first time. The 2012 iMac also features the option of a Fusion Drive which combines a SSD and a conventional HDD to create more efficient and faster storage.</string>

			<string>Originally, the Multiple Scan series covered both entry-level and professional displays. However, by 1995, Apple released the AppleVision series which was especially built for professional users. Therefore, Apple needed entry-level displays for their consumer customers. The Multiple Scan series became Apple's entry-level display series. All following Multiple Scan displays were equipped with cheaper Shadow Mask tubes that supported lower resolutions and less colors. The last Multiple Scan display, the Multiple Scan 720 display, was released in 1997.</string>

			<string>The iPhone 6 Plus was unveiled during an Apple Special Event on September 9, 2014, alongside the iPhone 6 and the Apple Watch. The iPhone 6 line marks the first major increases in physical screen size for the iPhone line since the taller screen of the iPhone 5, measuring at 4.7 inches. The design of the iPhone 6 line is influenced by that of the iPad Air, with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminium rear. Both models will come in gold, silver, and space gray finishes. It includes an Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5S. The main difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is the inclusion of a barometer to measure altitude changes. Apple touted that the A8 chip would provide, in comparison to the 5S, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. LTE support is expanded on the iPhone 6 line, with support for over 20 LTE bands (7 more than the iPhone 5S), up to 150 Mbps download speed, and VoLTE support. Wi-Fi performance has been improved with support for 802.11ac specifications, providing speeds up to 433 mbps—which is up to 3 times faster than 802.11n, along with Wi-Fi Calling support where available. The iPhone 6 line adds support for near-field communications (NFC), which is used primarily for Apple Pay—a new mobile payments system which will allow users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC. While still 8 megapixels in size, the iPhone 6 line’s rear-facing camera includes a new sensor containing larger pixels for better performance in low-light conditions, a f/2.2 aperture lens, and the ability to shoot 1080p video at either 30 or 60 frames per second. The iPhone 6 Plus adds support for optical image stabilization, while the iPhone 6 retains digital image stabilization. The front-facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f/2.2 aperture, along with support for burst and HDR modes.</string>

			<string>The Lisa 2 was released in January 1984 and was priced between $3,495 and $5,495 U.S. It was much less expensive than the original model and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives in favor of a single 400k Sony microfloppy. It was possible to purchase the Lisa 2 with as little as 512 KB RAM. The Lisa 2/5 consisted of a Lisa 2 bundled with an external 5MB or 10MB hard drive. In 1984, at the same time the Macintosh was officially announced, Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2/5 to all Lisa 1 owners, by swapping the pair of Twiggy drives for a single 3.5-inch drive, and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM. In addition, the Lisa 2's new front faceplate was included to accommodate the reconfigured floppy disk drive. With this change, the Lisa 2 had the notable distinction of introducing the new Apple inlaid logo, as well as the first Snow White design language features. The Lisa 2/10 featured a 10MB internal hard drive (but no external parallel port) and a standard configuration of 1MB of RAM.</string>

			<string>The LC II was essentially an upgrade of the original LC. Unfortunately, while Apple "speed-bumped" the processor to a 16 MHz 68030, they kept the 16-bit data path, making the speed improvement minimal (the 68030 was a 32-bit processor). The LC II sold for $1240 U.S., making it one of the more affordable Macs ever. It was discontinued in March 1993, when it was replaced by the LC III. In September 1992, it was bundled with several different hard drives and software, and re-released as the Performa 400, 405, 410, and 430.</string>

			<string>Introduced in April 1996, the PowerMac 5400 LC looked the same as the 5200 on the outside, but inside was radically different. Running on a 120 MHz 603e processor (a high speed variant of the 603), and initially released only to educational markets, the 5400 was the first LC to use 168-pin DIMM sockets for memory expansion. It was also the first LC to include an industry-standard PCI slot, (although it also included the familiar LC comm, video i/o, and TV slots) and the first Macintosh computer to include enhanced SRS surround sound support. The 5400 was "speed bumped" to 180/200 MHz in February 1997, and discontinued in early 1998. It was also released in the consumer market as the Performas 5400CD, 5410CD, 5420CD, 5430CD and 5440CD, each with different hardware and software bundles. There was also a Performa 5420, which came in a black case similar to the failed Mac TV and was never released in the US.</string>

Again, based on a third party control panel; HAM by Microseeds publishing), System-wide drag and drop for text and other data (selections could be simply dragged with the mouse and dropped to their new destination, bypassing the clipboard), A scriptable Finder, QuickDraw GX, a 2-D graphics rendering and geometry engine, For the PowerPC only, an advanced, 3D Graphing Calculator, secretly developed at Apple by a former third party contractor, support for OpenDoc. System 7.5.1 was primarily a bug fix on 7.5, but also introduced a new "Mac OS" startup screen in preparation for Mac clones. System 7.5.2, released only for the first PCI-based Power Macs, was notable for introducing Apple's new networking architecture, Open Transport. System 7.5.3, a major bug-fix update that also included Open Transport for other PowerPC-based machines as well as some 68k-based machines. 7.5.3 also made several improvements to the 68k emulator, and added translucent dragging support to the Drag Manager. It was also the first version of Control Strip for all Macs. This was also the first version of Mac OS to support SMP. System 7.5.3 Revision 2 included: performance enhancements; better reliability for PowerBooks using the third-party RAM Doubler program; improved reliability for PowerBook 500, 2300, and 5300 series computers with the PowerPC Upgrade Card; improved reliability when using the Startup Disk control panel; and improved reliability when copying files to 1 GB hard disks. System 7.5.4 was pulled due to a mistake at Apple, in which some components were not included in the installer. System 7.5.5 included significant performance improvements for virtual memory and memory management on PowerPC-based Macs, including the elimination of one type 11 error. Also included were a number of reliability improvements, such as fixes for Macs using floppy disks equipped with a DOS compatibility card, improved hard disk access for PowerPC PowerBooks and Performa 5400 through 9500 computers, fixes for Macs that included an Apple TV Tuner or Macintosh TV Remote Control, improvements to LocalTalk and networking (especially for the Performa 5400 and 6400), fixes to system startup for the faster 180 MHz Macs (which included PowerPC 604 or 604e processors), improved reliability when using sound intensive applications on Quadra or Centris computers that contained the PowerPC upgrade card, and improved stability when using multiple background applications and shared printers on a network. System 7.5.5 is also the last System 7 release that can run on 68000-based Macs such as the Macintosh Plus. 7.6 and later required a 68030 processor.</string>

			<string>Announced in October 2008 and shipped in November, the MacBook Air (Late 2008) was no faster than its predecessor, in terms of processor speed. It gained performance, however, from a faster 1066 MHz bus, a larger 6 MB on-chip L2 cache, and a faster graphics chipset. In addition, the micro-DVI port was replaced with the new Mini DisplayPort, which was capable of driving a larger external display (2560x1600). The MacBook Air (Late 2008) shipped in two configurations: 1.6 GHz/2GB RAM/120 GB HD/$1799 U.S. and 1.86 GHz/2 GB RAM/128 GB solid-state/$2499 U.S.</string>

			<string>The AppleVision displays were designed as high-end monitors. They shipped with Sony Trinitron tubes for superb quality. In 1997, Apple released 'ColorSync', a powerful color management software. ColorSync enabled the user to match the colors of color documents while capturing, editing, and outputting. In order to take full advantage of this new software the AppleVision 1710 and 1710AV were discontinued and replaced by new displays. The new displays fully supported all features of the software and were therefore especially built for people that used their Macs mainly for image and photo editing.</string>

			<string>The iPad Air is the fifth generation iPad. Unveiled during a keynote on October 22, 2013, the iPad Air features the 64-bit Apple A7 processor along with a M7 coprocessor. The iPad Air marks the first major design change for the iPad since the iPad 2; it now features a thinner design that is 7.5 millimetres thick and has a smaller screen bezel similar to the iPad mini. Apple reduced the overall volume for the iPad Air by using thinner components resulting in a 25% reduction in weight over the iPad 2. Though it still uses the same 9.7-inch Retina display as the previous iPad model, an improved front-facing camera makes using FaceTime much clearer. The new front facing camera is capable of video in 720p HD, includes face detection, and backside illumination. The rear camera received an upgrade as well; now being called the iSight camera, in addition to the same functions as the front camera it also contains a 5MP CCD, hybrid IR filter and a fixed ƒ/2.4 aperture.</string>

			<string>System 3.0 debuted with the introduction of the Mac Plus. A much more efficient Finder, now at version 5.1, was also much speedier. This was in part due to the newly created Disk Cache, which would store frequently used routines and instructions in a chunk of memory. System 3.0 featured the full introduction of the Hierarchical File System (the system was first introduced with Apple's HD20 hard drive, but not publicly announced). The main benefit of HFS was the ability to finally nest folders (put folders within folders). MFS only allowed you to create folders at the root level, which would disappear in Open/Save dialog boxes and when rebuilding the desktop. HFS took care of that, allowing the creation of many nested folders. HFS was replaced in Mac OS 8.1 with HFS+, which better calculates file block sizes according to maximum hard disk capacity.</string>

			<string>On September 12, 2012, Apple announced the iPhone 5. It has 4-inch display, up from its predecessors' 3.5-inch screen. The device comes with the same 326 pixels per inch found in the iPhone 4 and 4S. The iPhone 5 has the SoC A6 processor, the chip is 22 percent smaller than the iPhone 4s’ A5 and is twice as fast, doubling the graphics performance of its predecessor. The device is 18 percent thinner than the iPhone 4s, measuring 7.6mm, and is 20 percent lighter at 112 grams. The iPhone 5, as well as the iPod Touch (5th generation), and iPod Nano (7th generation), feature a new dock connector named Lightning, which replaces the 30-pin Apple Dock connector introduced in 2003 by Apple on the iPod (3rd generation). The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signalling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one, helping the iPhone 5 to be slimmer than its predecessors. Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way round. Various accessories will be available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older 30-pin Apple Dock connector or USB.</string>

			<string>The original LaserWriter was released in 1985. Being the key feature of the "Macintosh Office" it was targeted at small businesses. Another feature of the Macintosh Office was Apple's new AppleTalk LAN technology making the LaserWriter Apple's first network printer. Just like Macintosh in 1984, the Macintosh Office was announced with a commercial during the fourth quarter of SuperBowl XIX ('Lemmings'). Worth approx. $7,000 U.S. the LaserWriter was in comparison with the competition rather inexpensive.</string>

			<string>Based around a 15-inch LCD screen, this iMac brought both the G4 processor and the CD-RW/DVD-R "Super Drive" to the consumer space for the first time. The iMac (Flat Panel) featured an entirely new case design, built around the idea of a screen that could rotate and change angles easily. The "desk lamp" design was mounted atop a semi-spherical base, 10.6 inches in diameter, which housed the rest of the computer. The machine had been developed over the course of two years, and was the culmination of Apple's move away from CRT displays. Steve Jobs proudly announced, when this new iMac was released, that "The CRT is officially dead." The iMac (Flat Panel) shipped in three configurations. The low-end model, with a 700 MHz G4 Processor, 128 MB of RAM, a 40 GB ATA-66 hard drive and a CD-RW drive, was $1299 U.S. Another 700 MHz model, with 256 MB of RAM, a 40 GB hard drive, and a CD-RW/DVD-ROM "Combo Drive," was priced at $1499 U.S. Finally, the 800 MHz model, with 256 MB of RAM, a 60 GB hard drive, and the CD-RW/DVD-R "SuperDrive," was $1799 U.S. The middle and high-end model shipped with Apple Pro Speakers.</string>

			<string>The iPod (Dock Connector) updated both the look-and-feel and the feature set of the existing iPod. The iPod (Dock Connector) was thinner and lighter than the original iPod, and it introduced several new hardware features. The FireWire port was replaced by a "dock connector" which allowed the iPod to connect to either a Mac or PC, using either FireWire or USB 2.0. The iPod (Dock Connector) had smoother angles than its predecessor, and moved the four buttons which had previously been arrayed around the scroll wheel to the top of the front face. These new buttons were backlit and solid state. Apple also added a variety of software feature enhancements to the new iPods, enhancements which were not made available on the older models.</string>

			<string>It took Apple over a year to upgrade the original Newton. The main reason was that the Newton team had worked hard for over 6 years and after the devastating press of the original Message Pad morale was low. The first revisions were Newton Message Pad 100 and 110. While the MP 100 was basically the original Message Pad with a new ROM, the MP 110 had a new design with a smaller screen and longer-lasting batteries. The Message Pad 130, released in early 1996 at CeBit in Germany, was the first Message Pad to feature an optional backlit display for better readability.</string>

			<string>The PowerMac G5 was Apple's long-awaited fifth generation PowerPC-based machine. In an important move, Apple decided to break with Motorola, and used an IBM-designed processor. Motorola had been chronically delayed for both processor design and shipment, and was at least a year away from its fifth-generation PowerPC CPU. Apple and IBM had worked closely together for nearly a year of the PowerPC 970 Processor (publicly referred to as the G5), and the 64-bit PowerMac G5 represented a huge leap forward in both processor and machine design. Housed in an innovative new Aluminum enclosure, the PowerMac G5 was the first 64-bit consumer-level desktop computer ever sold. It included a variety of logic board enhancements, including PCI-X slots, and 8X AGP slot, a Serial-ATA bus, and up to 8 GB of RAM. Most impressive of all was the front-side bus speed, which was increased to half of the processor speed-up to 1.0 GHz. This represented a more than six-fold improvement over the previous PowerMac G4 model. There were three configurations for the PowerMac G5. The 1.6 GHz model, with an 80 GB hard drive and 256 MB of RAM, sold for $1999 U.S. The 1.8 and dual 2.0 GHz models, both with a 160 GB hard drive and 512 MB of RAM, sold for $2399 U.S. and $2999 U.S. respectively.</string>

			<string>The PowerMac G4 (PCI Graphics) was announced in September 1999, along with the PowerMac G4 (AGP Graphics). Based on the same logic board as the "Blue and White" G3, the G4 PCI added a Motorola MPC 7400 processor to an already succesful machine. Originally, the MPC 7400 chip had been planned to debut in the G4 AGP model, but Apple was not able to get the new machine ready in time. The G4 PCI had been in the works in case of such an event, and allowed Apple to ship 7400-equipped machines while they worked out the final bugs of the G4 AGP. The G4 PCI introduced the new case design, similar to that of the Blue and White G3, but tinted in the new professional color, "graphite." The G4 PCI was priced at a modest $1599 U.S., and shipped standard with 64 MB of RAM, a 10 GB hard drive, a 32x CD-ROM, 56 kbps modem. Zip and DVD-ROM/RAM drives were available as BTO options. There were extreme supply issues with the G4 initially and this was further compounded by an "erratum" in the initial revision of the 7400 that effectively lowered the ceiling of the chip to 450MHz. As a result, all models of the G4 were "speed dumped" in October.</string>

The MacBook Pro no longer included FireWire800, s-video or modem ports (a USB modem was available separately), and the slot-loading SuperDrive no longer supported dual-layer DVD+R media.

			<string>Mac OS X version 10.4 "Tiger" is the fifth major release of Mac OS X, Apple’s desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers. Tiger was released to the public on April 29, 2005 as the successor to Mac OS X v10.3 "Panther", which was released 18 months earlier, and was superseded by Mac OS X v10.5 "Leopard" on October 26, 2007, after 30 months, making Mac OS X v10.4 the longest running version of the Mac OS X operating system. Some of the new features include a fast searching system called Spotlight, a new version of the Safari web browser, Dashboard, a new ‘Unified’ theme, and improved support for 64-bit addressing on Power Mac G5s. Mac OS X x10.4 "Tiger" was included with all new Macintosh computers, and was also available as an upgrade for existing Mac OS X users, or users of supported pre-Mac OS X systems. The server edition, Mac OS X Server 10.4, was also available for some Macintosh product lines. Tiger is also the first version of any released Apple operating system to work on Apple-Intel architecture machines (Apple machines using x86 processors). The Apple TV, as released in March 2007, ships with a customized version of Mac OS X v10.4 branded "Apple TV OS" that replaces the usual graphical user interface with an updated version of Front Row. Six weeks after its official release, Apple had delivered 2 million copies of Tiger, representing 16 percent of all Mac OS X users. Apple claimed that Tiger was the most successful Apple OS release in the company’s history. At the Worldwide Developers Conference on June 11, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced that out of the 22 million OS X users, more than 67 percent were using Tiger.</string>

			<string>The Mac mini represented Apple's first real foray into the low-end consumer market, and Apple's first monitor-less consumer Mac in more than six years. Based around the basic logic board design of the eMac (USB 2.0), the Mac mini packed an impressive feature set into a very small package, just two inches tall and 6.5 inches wide and deep. The Mac mini shipped in two configurations. The low-end 1.25 GHz model, with a 40 GB hard drive, was $499 U.S., while the high-end 1.42 GHz model, with an 80 GB hard drive, was $599 U.S. Both models shipped with 256 MB of RAM. In July 2005, Apple upgraded all models to 512 MB of RAM. It also added AirPort Extreme and Bluetooth. Finally, a higher-end model, which included a 4x SuperDrive, was made available for $699 U.S.</string>

			<string>Development of a tablet computer by Apple began with the creation and introduction of the Newton based MessagePad 100 in 1993. Part of this development process led to the creation of the ARM6 core as a collaboration between Apple and Acorn Computers. Apple had at the same time developed a prototype tablet computer named the PenLite but did not release it as it did not wish to affect Newton sales. Several more Newton based PDAs were introduced until the MessagePad 2100, the final in the series of Apple PDAs, was discontinued in 1998. Development of tablet computer prototypes within Apple began as early as 2000. The development of the tablet, specifically Apple's multi-touch technology, was combined with the development of the iPhone and iPod Touch and included technology Apple had gained from its acquisition of FingerWorks in 2005. The product was announced on January 27, 2010 at an Apple press conference at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The device's imminent release had been rumored for several months with iSlate and iTablet among speculated names.</string>

			<string>Apple announced iPod shuffle at Macworld Expo on January 11, 2005 with the taglines "Life is random" and "Give chance a chance". iPod shuffle introduced flash memory (rather than a hard drive) to iPods for the first time. The shuffle comes in two models: 512 MB (up to 120, 4-minute songs encoded at 128 kbit/s) and 1 GB (up to 240). Unlike other iPod models, iPod shuffle cannot play Apple Lossless or AIFF encoded audio files—possibly due to the iPod shuffle's smaller processing power. The shuffle has a SigmaTel processor. One review regards it as having one of the best-sounding audio systems of all the iPod models.</string>

			<string>On August 7, 2007, Apple released a completely redesigned model of the Apple Wireless Keyboard. Like the wired Apple Keyboard, the new model is thinner than its predecessors and has an aluminum enclosure. Another addition is the new functions added to the function keys, such as media controls and Dashboard control. Unlike the previous version, the Wireless Keyboard now has a layout similar to the MacBook. The power button has been relocated to the right side of the keyboard, and the layout does not include a numeric keypad. This model added accidental caps lock prevention: the key has to be held down for a moment for caps lock to engage. This keyboard required only three AA batteries, one fewer than its predecessor. In October 2009, a slightly revised third model was released. New model number A1314 replaced the A1255, two years and two months after the initial release. The new model now uses only two AA batteries instead of three originally. Additionally, Mac OS X 10.5.8 is now the minimum OS over the original Mac OS X 10.4.10. This model of keyboard become standard with new generation of iMacs introduced on the same day. In 2011, Apple updated the keyboard slightly, updating the label on the Exposé key and changing the Dashboard key to a Launchpad key.</string>

			<string>Although officially produced in celebration of the 20th Anniversary of Apple, the 20th Anniversary Mac was released close to a year after the fact. The logic board was similar to that of the PowerMac 5500, and it was based on the same 603e processor, running at 250MHz. The real innovation of the 20th Anniversary Mac was its unique shape, and advanced sound and video features. It came with an integrated TV/FM Radio System, an S-video Input, and a custom sound system designed by Bose, with integrated stereo speakers, and a separate sub-woofer. The TAM was a limited edition, and sold for nearly $10,000 U.S. Its price was cut to as low as $1,999 U.S. in March 1998.</string>

			<string>Announced in January 2009, the MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2009) adopted the aluminum "Unibody" case design of its smaller sibling, the MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2008), along with many of the same architectural improvements. These included the glass-covered, clickable multi-touch trackpad, faster bus speed, a Mini DisplayPort, and two fully independent graphics chipsets. The most notable change to the MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2009) was to the battery. Instead of including a replaceable battery, which had been standard on Apple notebooks since the original PowerBook 100, Apple chose to embed a custom-designed, built-in battery, capable of up to 8 hours of use on a single charge. Apple claimed that the integrated battery would retain 80 percent or more of its original capacity for up 1,000 recharge cycles, making replacement a non-issue for most customers. Depleted batteries could be replaced (and recycled) by Apple for $179 U.S. The MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2009) shipped in a single configuration, with a 2.66 GHz processor, 4 GB of RAM and a 320 GB hard drive, for $2,799 U.S. Built-to-order options included a faster 2.93 GHz processor, up to 8 GB of RAM, a 320 GB 7200 RPM hard drive, and 128 or 256 GB solid-state drives.</string>

			<string>The last of the Quadra line, the Quadra 630 was introduced in June 1994. The 630 was a hybrid of a Quadra and an LC in a sleek new case. It had an internal IDE hard drive (the 630 was the first Mac to use the IDE bus), and an optional CD-ROM drive. It sold for $1,200, and was also released as the LC 630, and the Performa 630, 630CD, 631CD, 635CD, 636, 636CD, 637CD, 638CD, and 640CD, each of which was bundled with different software, accessories, monitors, and hard drives (some Performas had a 68LC040, and several were also available with several x86-based DOS cards). The Quadra 630 was discontinued in August 1995.</string>

			<string>Released in 1984, the ImageWriter was the first printer exclusively built for the Macintosh series. Its predecessor, the Apple Dot Matrix Printer, was discontinued soon after the released of the ImageWriter. The ImageWriter was a low-cost dot-matrix printer with QuickDraw support. Because of the relatively small price and high printing speed, the ImageWriter series was extremely popular amongst consumer computer users. In 1990 the ImageWriter series was replaced by the ink-jet StyleWriter series.</string>

			<string>Ever since the release of the LaserWriter in 1985 the laser printing technology did not develop much. The ink jet printers became more and more attractive due to their low price and by mid 1990s they even offered good quality for color print-outs. In 1995, ten years after the release of the original LaserWriter, Apple introduced the Color LaserWriter series. The Color LaserWriters were the most expensive printers by Apple ever. The print-out quality was superb, but the price for the printer and the color print-outs, even though justified, was too high. The Color LaserWriter did not sell well and therefore the Color LaserWriter series was discontinued two years after introduction.</string>

			<string>The iPod was a hard disk based digital music player that was smaller than most portable tape decks. The iPod could compete with both flash-based and hard disk based players: By using a 1.8" hard disk, Apple was able to make the iPod smaller than most other hard disk MP3 players, small enough to go up against flash-based players, whose capacity was more than an order of magnitude less than the 5 GB available on the iPod. The 5 GB iPod was priced at $399 U.S. In March 2002, Apple added a 10 GB model to its iPod lineup, for $499 U.S. Several months later, in July 2002, Apple replaced the mechanical scroll wheel with a solid-state touch wheel, added a $499 U.S. 20 GB model, and dropped the prices of the 5 and 10 GB models to $299 U.S. and $399 U.S., respectively (The 5 GB iPod kept its mechanical scroll wheel). In addition, Apple for the first time made iPods available to Windows users.</string>

The Apple Keyboard was a more solid version of the Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard.

Aside from weight the main difference was the significantly thicker frame width.</string>

			<string>iOS 7 was unveiled during the opening keynote of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2013. Billed as the "biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the iPhone", the most noticeable change was an overhaul of the user interface. In a promotional video shown during the keynote, Jonathan Ive (Senior Vice President of Design) described the update as "bringing order to complexity", highlighting features such as refined typography, new icons, translucency, layering, physics, and gyroscope-driven parallaxing as some of the major changes to the design. The design of both iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks (version 10.9) noticeably depart from skeuomorphic elements such as green felt in Game Center, wood in Newsstand, and leather in Calendar, in favor of flatter graphic design. The UI itself is not flat, but rather a multi-plane 2.5D zooming user interface. In his segment of the iOS presentation, Craig Federighi (Senior Vice President of Software Engineering) emphasized ten major feature additions and changes.</string>

			<string>The LC II was essentially an upgrade of the original LC. Unfortunately, while Apple "speed-bumped" the processor to a 16 MHz 68030, they kept the 16-bit data path, making the speed improvement minimal (the 68030 was a 32-bit processor). The LC II sold for $1240 U.S., making it one of the more affordable Macs ever. It was discontinued in March 1993, when it was replaced by the LC III. In September 1992, it was bundled with several different hard drives and software, and re-released as the Performa 400, 405, 410, and 430.</string>

			<string>The AppleVision displays were designed as high-end monitors. They shipped with Sony Trinitron tubes for superb quality. In 1997, Apple released 'ColorSync', a powerful color management software. ColorSync enabled the user to match the colors of color documents while capturing, editing, and outputting. In order to take full advantage of this new software the AppleVision 1710 and 1710AV were discontinued and replaced by new displays. The new displays fully supported all features of the software and were therefore especially built for people that used their Macs mainly for image and photo editing.</string>

			<string>Development of a tablet computer by Apple began with the creation and introduction of the Newton based MessagePad 100 in 1993. Part of this development process led to the creation of the ARM6 core as a collaboration between Apple and Acorn Computers. Apple had at the same time developed a prototype tablet computer named the PenLite but did not release it as it did not wish to affect Newton sales. Several more Newton based PDAs were introduced until the MessagePad 2100, the final in the series of Apple PDAs, was discontinued in 1998. Development of tablet computer prototypes within Apple began as early as 2000. The development of the tablet, specifically Apple's multi-touch technology, was combined with the development of the iPhone and iPod Touch and included technology Apple had gained from its acquisition of FingerWorks in 2005. The product was announced on January 27, 2010 at an Apple press conference at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The device's imminent release had been rumored for several months with iSlate and iTablet among speculated names.</string>

			<string>In late 1997, parallel to the new Power Macintosh G3, Apple re-named the ColorSync displays and discontinued the AppleVision displays. The ColorSync displays were now called ColorSync 17" and 20" display. The ColorSync display series was discontinued with the release of Power Macintosh G3 (Blue and White) and the new Studio Display series. The ColorSync technology, however, remained beyond that the industry standard for color management.</string>

			<string>The Macintosh has the distinction of launching the mouse as the indispensable computing device we know it as today. However, its mouse was little changed from the original Lisa version and is completely interchangeable. The case was a slightly darker brown than Lisa's beige coloring and it had less formal lines, with a thick chamfer around its edges to match the Macintosh case. Mechanically the Lisa's steel ball was replaced by a rubber one, but otherwise connected with the same DE-9 connectors, though updated with a square-shape and standard thumb screws.</string>

			<string>On October 14, 2008, the 23-inch Cinema Display was replaced with a 24-inch model made with aluminium and glass which had a similar appearance to the latest iMac, MacBook Pro and unibody MacBook designs. The display features a built-in iSight camera, microphone, and dual speaker system. A MagSafe cable runs from the back of the display for charging notebooks. It is the first Cinema Display to use LED backlighting and the Mini DisplayPort for video input. This display is only officially compatible with Macs that have the Mini DisplayPort connector. A third-party converter must be used in order to use this display with older Macs. On July 26, 2010, the 24-inch and 30-inch Cinema Displays were replaced by a 27-inch model that supports up to 2560 × 1440 resolution, making it the only Cinema Display then in production.</string>

			<string>Announced in July 2001, the iMac (Summer 2001) represented a minor change to the existing iMac line, and represented a shift back to a more conservative color-scheme. The iMac (Summer 2001) was initially available in three configurations. The 500 MHz model, with 128 MB of RAM and a 20 GB hard drive was $999 U.S., and was available in Indigo and Snow. The 600 MHz model, with 256 MB of RAM and a 40 GB hard drive, was $1,299 U.S., and was available in Graphite and Snow. Finally the 700 MHz model, with 256 MB of RAM and a 60 GB hard drive was $1,499 U.S., and was available in Graphite and Snow. A low-end $799 U.S. configuration was later added, with a 500 MHz processor, 64 MB of RAM, a 20 GB hard drive, and a CD-ROM drive, and was available only in Indigo. Following the announcement of the new G4 Flat Panel iMac in January 2002, the iMac "G3" was repriced. The 600 MHz model, with 256 MB of RAM, a 40 GB hard drive and a CD-RW drive, was available in either Snow or Graphite for $999 U.S. The 500 MHz model, with 128 MB of RAM, a 20 GB hard drive, and a CD-ROM drive, was available only in indigo for $799 U.S. The 700 MHz model was discontinued.</string>

			<string>Released in September 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 was a major step from Mac OS X 10.0. While Mac OS 10.0 felt like another beta, 10.1 was the first OS X release which could actually be used. Application launch time, window resizing and menus were significantly faster, the Dock was moveable, more customizable interface, enhanced 3D graphics performance, hundreds of drivers for third-party printers, cameras, camcorders, MP3 players and storage devices and additional network integration just to name a few of the new or improved features. Mac OS X 10.1 was a free upgrade for owners of Mac OS X 10.0. However, due to its size it was not available via Internet download, but could either be ordered directly from Apple for $20 or was available in the Apple Stores on burned CD-Rs.</string>

			<string>The iBook was perhaps the most anxiously awaited Apple computer ever. Aimed at the same consumer market as its big brother, the iMac, the iBook filled the 2x2 consumer/pro/desktop/portable matrix that Steve Jobs had first detailed more than a year earlier. The iBook did have a number of semi-revolutionary features for such a low-end machine. It was the first Mac to include AGP-based graphics, and included a handle, a feature rarely seen in a portable. The iBook was the first Mac released using Unified logic board Architecture (UMA), which allowed Apple to standardize most logic board components across all product lines. The most exciting new feature of the iBook was the inclusion of AirPort, a wireless networking system based on existing industry standards. AirPort allowed up to 10 iBooks to connect to a single base-station, which could then be plugged into an existing ethernet network or a standard phone line. At $1599 U.S., The iBook was $900 U.S. less expensive than Apple's lowest-priced professional PowerBook. The iBook received a minor revision in February 2000, when the logic board RAM was raised to 64 MB, and the hard disk was bumped up to 6 GB.</string>

			<string>Mac OS X version 10.5 "Leopard" is the sixth major release of the Mac OS X operating system for Apple’s Mac line of personal computers, and is the successor to Mac OS X v10.4 "Tiger". Leopard was released on October 26, 2007, and was available in two variants: a desktop version suitable for personal computers, and a server version, Mac OS X Server. Apple offered a reduced-cost upgrade to people that purchase new Apple computers between October 1, 2007 and December 29, 2007 that do not already have Mac OS X v10.5 pre-installed or a Leopard upgrade DVD included. According to Apple, Leopard contains over 300 changes and enhancements,covering core operating system components as well as included applications and developer tools. Leopard introduced a significantly revised desktop, with a redesigned Dock, Stacks, a semitransparent menu bar, and an updated Finder that incorporates the Cover Flow visual navigation interface first seen in iTunes. Other notable features include support for writing 64-bit graphical user interface applications, an automated backup utility called Time Machine, support for Spotlight searches across multiple machines, and the inclusion of Front Row and Photo Booth, which were previously only included with some Mac models. Apple missed Mac OS X v10.5’s release time frame as originally announced by Apple CEO Steve Jobs. When first discussed in June 2005, Jobs had stated that Apple intended to release Leopard at the end of 2006 or early 2007. A year later, this was amended to "Spring 2007"; however on April 12, 2007, Apple issued a statement that its release would be delayed until October 2007 because of the development of the iPhone.</string>

Housed in a completely new enclosure reminiscent of Apple's Cinema Display line, the iMac G5 was a marvel of miniaturization.

			<string>It took Apple more than six and a half years to develop the first Newton MessagePad. When it was finally released it had impressive specifications. 20 MHz processor, pressure-sensitive LCD-display, LocalTalk port, infra-red beamer. However, all these features were overshadowed by the Newtons handwriting recognition. It was Apple's pride and the expectations were high. However, it was far away from its promised 95 percent accuracy.</string>

			<string>The Mac Pro completed Apple's transition to Intel processors, replacing the PowerMac G5 (Late 2005) as Apple's professional desktop Mac. The Mac Pro was based on two 64-bit, dual-core Intel Xeon 5100 "Woodcrest" processors, which included a 128-bit Vector Engine. The Mac Pro's case resembled its PowerMac predecessor's--with the exception of a second optical drive bay--but the interior of the case was completely redesigned. The Xeon processors required less heat-dissipation than G5 processors, allowing a smaller cooling system. The Mac Pro had four easily accessible hard drive bays (for a BTO maximum of 2 TB of storage) and easy access to its 8 RAM slots, which allowed for a maximum of 16 GB of RAM. With the Mac Pro, Apple decided to do something different in terms of configuration. Since the majority of Apple's professional customers tended to heavily-customize their Macs at purchase time, Apple offered a single, heavily customizable Mac Pro model. The single model sold for $2,499 U.S., and included two 2.66 GHz, dual-core Intel Xeon 5100 processors, 1 GB of RAM, a 250 GB hard disk, a SuperDrive, and an Nvidia GeForce 7300GT graphics card with 256MB of VRAM. BTO options included 2.0 and 3.0 GHz processors, up to 16 GB of RAM, up to 2 TB of storage, a second SuperDrive, a variety of graphics cards, and AirPort and Bluetooth support.</string>

The 21.5" and 27" screens remained at their previous resolutions, 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 respectively. RAM has been upgraded; the standard specification is now 8GB, with 32GB being the optional maximum on the 27" model. Apple also upgraded the computers' processors, using Intel's Ivy Bridge microarchitecture-based Core i5 and Core i7. Video cards are now Nvidia as standard. USB 3.0 ports are now included for the first time.

			<string>Only four months after the release of the Macintosh, Apple updated the OS to System 1.1. The main advantage of System 1.1 by far was a dramatic speed increase in disk copying. Apple accomplished the task by increasing the Finder's memory buffer, therefore allowing the Finder to copy larger chunks of data at a time and reducing the number of disk swaps needed. The new System started up 20% faster due to improved code. The Finder also launched faster at startup, and after exiting other applications. Another interesting feature added was the Set Startup command in the Special menu. It allowed you to automatically set applications to launch upon System startup, similar to the Startup Items folder today. The Clean Up command also debuted in this version under the Special menu, which set the icons in specified grids which made you windows and desktop look nice and tidy. Fonts and Font Mover were added, as the Mac was starting to evolve into a desktop publishing machine. More aesthetic updates included the About the Finder dialog box, with the now famous "mountain scene" in the Apple Menu.</string>

			<string>In 1992 Apple started to develop its first digital camera - the "Venus" project. At that time over U.S. 12 billion were spent annually in the US for photography. Therefore, there was a huge market for digital photography. The QuickTake 100 digital camera was an easy-to-use digital camera with a 1 MB Flash-card. By releasing a connection-kit for Windows for QuickTake 150 Apple tried to sell its digital camera to Windows users as well.

			<string>Released January 19, 1998, Mac OS 8.1 was the last version to run on both m68k- and PowerPC-based Macintoshes. It introduced the new, optional HFS Plus file system format (also known as the Mac OS Extended Format), which supported large file sizes, longer file names and made more efficient use of the space on larger drives due to using a smaller block size. To upgrade, you had to wipe out the contents of your entire hard drive before upgrading to HFS Plus, although some third-party utilities later appeared that held your data steady while upgrading silently to HFS Plus. Mac OS 8.1 also included an enhanced version of PC Exchange, allowing Macintosh users to see the long file names (up to 255 characters) on files that had been created on PCs running Windows 95. It is the earliest version that can run Carbon apps.</string>

			<string>The Magic Trackpad's design is similar to the trackpad found on the current MacBook family of laptops, but 80 percent larger. It connects via Bluetooth and runs on two AA batteries. The trackpad is designed in the same style as Apple's Wireless Keyboard, and when put next to one, sits flush to it. Usage can be compared to the multitouch trackpads found in Apple's MacBook and Macbook Pro laptops. Additionally, the entire pad can be clicked; pressing on the device puts pressure on it and the surface it is resting on, pushing down two circular feet at the base of the trackpad, registering a click. The trackpad's required software update also added inertial scrolling and three-finger drag gestures to certain MacBook and MacBook Pro models.</string>

			<string>Steve Jobs, CEO at Apple Inc., conceived an idea of using a multi-touch touchscreen to interact with a computer in a way in which he could type directly onto the display, essentially removing the physical keyboard and mouse, the same as a tablet computer. Jobs recruited a group of Apple engineers to investigate the idea as a side project. When Jobs reviewed the prototype and its user interface, he conceived a second idea of implementing the technology onto a mobile phone. The whole effort was called Project Purple 2 and began in 2005. The original iPhone was introduced by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007 in a keynote address at the Macworld Conference and Expo held in Moscone West in San Francisco, California. In his address, Jobs said, "I have been looking forward to this for two and a half years", and that "today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone." Jobs introduced the iPhone as a combination of three devices: a "widescreen iPod with touch controls"; a "revolutionary mobile phone"; and a "breakthrough Internet communicator".</string>

			<string>During a special iPod-centric event on September 5, 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the sixth generation iPod and the retronym suffix "classic". Featuring slightly thinner bodies, the sixth generation classic also sported dramatically improved battery life, reaching up to 40 hours of music playback and 7 hours of video playback. The front plate of the iPod is now made of anodized aluminum instead of polycarbonate plastic, and Signature iPod White has been replaced by silver. The sixth generation classic also introduced a completely overhauled user interface, incorporating more graphics and Cover Flow. The sixth generation classic is offered in an 80 GB (20,000 songs) model for US$249 and a 160 GB (40,000 songs) model for US$349. The U2 special edition has been dropped.</string>

			<string>At a media event on September 1, 2010, Apple announced the sixth generation iPod Nano, which among many new features, will be designed around a high resolution "square shaped" touch-screen. Some notable changes are as follows: the device now features a smaller 1.54 inch lower resolution (higher pixel density) screen which supports multi-touch, as opposed to the 2.2 inch screen on the iPod nano 5g. The device supports over 24 hours of music playback on a single charge. The device retains the same 30-pin dock connector as previous generations. The new iPod Nano does not support video playback. Additionally, the device no longer has a camera or voice recorder, as Apple's market research determined that many customers rarely used those features in the previous generation devices. The iPod Nano lost its built in speaker. The 6th generation iPod is at the same price point as the 5th generation device. It still includes Nike fitness option and the FM Radio Tuner.</string>

			<string>On September 12, 2012, Apple announced the iPhone 5. It has 4-inch display, up from its predecessors' 3.5-inch screen. The device comes with the same 326 pixels per inch found in the iPhone 4 and 4S. The iPhone 5 has the SoC A6 processor, the chip is 22 percent smaller than the iPhone 4s A5 and is twice as fast, doubling the graphics performance of its predecessor. The device is 18 percent thinner than the iPhone 4s, measuring 7.6mm, and is 20 percent lighter at 112 grams. The iPhone 5, as well as the iPod Touch (5th generation), and iPod Nano (7th generation), feature a new dock connector named Lightning, which replaces the 30-pin Apple Dock connector introduced in 2003 by Apple on the iPod (3rd generation). The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signalling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one, helping the iPhone 5 to be slimmer than its predecessors. Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way round. Various accessories are available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older 30-pin Apple Dock connector or USB.</string>

			<string>Ever since the release of the LaserWriter in 1985 the laser printing technology did not develop much. The ink jet printers became more and more attractive due to their low price and by mid 1990s they even offered good quality for color print-outs. In 1995, ten years after the release of the original LaserWriter, Apple introduced the Color LaserWriter series. The Color LaserWriters were the most expensive printers by Apple ever. The print-out quality was superb, but the price for the printer and the color print-outs, even though justified, was too high. The Color LaserWriter did not sell well and therefore the Color LaserWriter series was discontinued two years after introduction.</string>

			<string>Introduced in March of 2009, the Mac mini (Early 2009) replaced the Mac mini (Mid 2007) which, after 19 months, was overdue for a refresh. In fact, prior to the release of the Mac mini (Early 2009), many had assumed that the Mac mini was no longer a platform Apple was interested in continuing to sell. Though the processor speed remained unchanged, the Mac mini (Early 2009) received the same architectural improvements that had been deliberately rolled out to other Macs over the course of the previous few months: faster data and memory buses, a better graphics chipset, and a Mini DisplayPort. Unlike all other models to date that included an on-board Mini DisplayPort, the Mac mini also included a mini-DVI port, making it the first Mac mini to support dual monitors. The Mac mini (Early 2009) kept in place the price structure introduced with the Mac mini (Early 2006): The $599 U.S. model included 1 GB of RAM, a 120 GB hard drive, and 128 MB of VRAM, while the $799 U.S. model included 2 GB of RAM, a 320 GB hard drive, and 256 MB of VRAM.</string>

			<string>The MacBook replaced the existing 12- and 14-inch iBooks and 12-inch PowerBook model, completing the transition of Apple's portable computers to Intel Processors. The MacBook shipped in a newly-designed case, built around a 13.3-inch "glossy" LCD panel, and included many of the system enhancements of the previously announced MacBook Pro. Two features unique to the MacBook were a magnetic latching system with no moving parts, and a redesigned recessed keyboard. One potential drawback to the new MacBook was that its graphic chipset used a portion of main memory, resulting in less RAM available for system tasks. The MacBook shipped in three configurations. The low-end model, with a 1.83 GHz Core Duo processor, 512 MB of RAM, a 60 GB hard drive, and a CD-RW/DVD-ROM Combo Drive, sold for $1,099 U.S. The middle-end model, with a 2.0 GHz Core Duo processor, 512 MB of RAM, a 60 GB hard drive, and a CD-RW/DVD±RW SuperDrive, sold for $1,299 U.S. Finally, a high-end model shipped in a black case (the first black Apple portable in more than five years). It improved upon the middle-end model with an 80 GB hard drive, and sold for $1,499 U.S.</string>

			<string>Four months after the Macintosh debut, the Apple IIc was introduced with the addition of an optional mouse to manipulate standard 80 column text. The mouse was similar to the Macintosh mouse, though it was in a creamy-beige color that co-ordinated with the IIc's bright off-white case and had a slightly modified design which was sleeker than the Macintosh's blockier shape. It also was uniformly the same color, eliminating the Mac and Lisa's contrasting taupe accents on the mouse button and cable. Unlike the Macintosh, the IIc Mouse shared a dual purpose port with gaming devices like joysticks. In order for the IIc to know what was plugged into it, its mouse had to send the appropriate signal. Despite these differences, it carried exactly the same model number as the Macintosh version. Since the original Apple Mouse IIc was compatible across all platforms, Apple renamed the mouse in 1985 and offered it as an optional purchase for all computers and separate from the Apple II interface card. It featured an updated mechanism and the new uniform rounded cable connector.</string>

			<string>The Mac IIfx was the fastest Mac ever built at the time. The IIfx shipped in a Mac II-style case, and could accommodate up to two Super Drives and internal SCSI hard disk. Dubbed "Wicked Fast" by the press, the IIfx also contained a number of proprietary ASICs designed to speed up the machine further. These required software written specifically for the IIfx to run at top speed, but either way it was an extremely powerful machine. It sold for $10,000 - $12,000 U.S., depending on configuration.</string>

			<string>Xserve RAID holds up to 14 hot-swappable Ultra-ATA hard drives, and current models have a maximum capacity of 10.5 TB when filled with 750 GB modules. Xserve RAID can be configured for most RAID levels. It is rack-mountable and is 3U high. Xserve RAID manages its hard drives with two identical RAID controller chipsets. The controllers are independent, but not redundant; each manages seven of the storage array's fourteen drives, given a failure of one of the controllers the other cannot take over its duties. Xserve RAID does, however, have redundant cooling units and power supplies. Xserve RAID's ports are two Fibre Channel ports for regular data transfer, a 10/100 Ethernet port for remote management, and a serial port for UPS communication via the Simple Signaling Protocol. Apple markets Xserve RAID mainly as a companion to Xserve in file server and high-performance technical computing applications, but the storage array is also useful in some professional environments such as non-linear video editing. Xserve RAID is available in models costing between $5,999 U.S. and $12,999 U.S., plus configuration and support options.</string>

			<string>System 6 is still widely considered to be the best system software version for the Macintoshes compatible with it. Cooperative multitasking made its Macintosh debut in March 1985 with a program called Switcher, which allowed the user to launch multiple applications and switch between them. However, many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher, and it did not come with the operating system, so it had to be acquired from Apple separately. System 6 featured a much more seamless approach called MultiFinder. MultiFinder originally debuted with System 5 (System file 4.2 / Finder 6.0). Multitasking under System 6 was optional — startup could be set to Finder or MultiFinder. If MultiFinder was selected, the Finder and its functions continued to run when an application was launched. The MultiFinder environment allowed users to see past the windows of running applications to view Finder icons such as the Trash, or the windows of other applications running in the background.</string>

			<string>In March 2001, Apple released the first (official) version of Mac OS X. The first release could hardly be called finished, but Apple felt that it was more important to meet the schedule. Mac OS X 10.0 was still very slow (much slower than Mac OS 9) and lacked some important features such as data CD burning or DVD video playback. Especially window resizing was extremely slow. Nonetheless, it showed many improvements over the Public Beta and it also proved that Apple was listening to the comments and criticism of the users. The lack of available software was the main problem. The first apps to appear were mostly shareware software and it took some time before the first major applications were ported to run natively under OS X.</string>

			<string>The iPhone 5c is one of two successors to the iPhone 5, along with its higher-end counterpart, the iPhone 5s. Apple held an event to formally introduce the iPhone 5c and 5s on September 10, 2013. The 5c uses much of the same hardware as the iPhone 5, lacking new features from the 5s: it uses the previous A6 chip from the iPhone 5 instead of the A7, does not include fingerprint recognition, and lacks the Burst iSight camera mode and Slow-motion video recording mode. It uses a polycarbonate casing (in blue, green, pink, yellow, and white colors) instead of the metal used by the 5 and 5s. On March 18, 2014 a 8 GB version of the device was released but will be sold in only five markets: U.K., France, Germany, Australia and China.</string>

			<string>Announced in October 2008, The MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2008) featured a stunning case redesign, the first in the 15-inch MacBook Pro (née PowerBook) line in more than five years. The two-piece "Unibody" case was carved from a single block of aluminum, which made it both extremely strong and impressively thin. The MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2008) also featured a striking glass-covered screen, and a new glass-covered, clickable trackpad, which used Apple's Multi-Touch technology, with support for two, three, and four-finger gestures. Under the hood, the MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2008) included a number of architectural improvements, though the processor speed remained the same as the previous MacBook Pro. The primary improvement was to the graphics subsystem, which included two fully independent graphics chipsets, the high-performance NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT and the lower-power GeForce 9400M. In place of the full-size, dual-link DVI port of the previous model was the smaller Mini DisplayPort. The MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2008) shipped in two configurations: 2.4 GHz/2 GB RAM/256 MB VRAM/250 GB HD/$1999 U.S., 2.53 GHz/4 GB RAM/512 MB VRAM/320 GB HD/$2499 U.S. Both models included a backlit-keyboard. Built-to-order options included a 2.8 GHz processor, 250 and 320 GB 7200 RPM hard drives and a 128 GB solid-state drive.

			<string>The Apple III (often rendered as Apple ///) is a business-oriented personal computer intended as the successor to the Apple II series, but largely considered a failure in the market. The machine was first announced and released on May 19, 1980, but due to serious stability issues that required a design overhaul and a recall of existing machines, it was formally reintroduced the following autumn. The Apple III was designed to be a business computer and an eventual successor for the Apple II. While the Apple II contributed to the inspirations of several important business products, such as VisiCalc, Multiplan and Apple Writer, the computer's hardware architecture, operating system and developer environment were limited. The Apple III addressed these weaknesses. According to Steve Wozniak, VisiCalc and Disk II had caused the Apple II's popularity, with 90% of sales going to businesses as opposed to the hobbyists that were its original market. Once the logic board design flaws were discovered, a newer logic board design was produced – which included a lower power requirement, wider traces and better designed chip sockets. The $3,495 U.S. revised model also included 256 KB RAM as a standard configuration. The 14,000 units of the original Apple III sold were returned and replaced with the entirely new revised model. The Apple III Plus was introduced in December 1983 at a price of $2,995 U.S. This newer version included a built-in clock, video interlacing, standardized rear port connectors, 256K RAM as standard, and a re-designed keyboard. The keyboard was designed in the style of the earlier beige Apple IIe. Owners of the earlier Apple III could obtain the newer logic board as a service replacement. A keyboard upgrade kit, dubbed "Apple III Plus upgrade kit" was also made available – which included the keyboard, cover, keyboard encoder ROM and logo replacements.</string>

			<string>The codename of this version of Mac OS X became publicly known long before the release of 10.2 and therefore Apple decided to officially refer to this version of Mac OS X as Jaguar. Jaguar improved the performance of Mac OS X by featuring Quartz Extreme, a new version of Quartz that took advantage of the graphics accelerator cards on the modern Macs. The Mail application now had a built-in spam mail filter, which was considered to be one of the best available. Furthermore, Apple added handwriting recognition called Inkwell. Inkwell was based on Apple's Newton handwriting recognition. New applications were also introduced such as iChat, QuickTime 6 and Sherlock 3 (and also adding a classic-Mac OS-like quick search to the Finder). Apple also added Bluetooth support and introduced Rendezvous. Another feature that was included on the demand of the users were the spring-loading folders which were available under Mac OS 9, but were missing in the first two releases of Mac OS X. Jaguar was sold for $129 U.S.</string>

			<string>The LC II was essentially an upgrade of the original LC. Unfortunately, while Apple "speed-bumped" the processor to a 16 MHz 68030, they kept the 16-bit data path, making the speed improvement minimal (the 68030 was a 32-bit processor). The LC II sold for $1240 U.S., making it one of the more affordable Macs ever. It was discontinued in March 1993, when it was replaced by the LC III. In September 1992, it was bundled with several different hard drives and software, and re-released as the Performa 400, 405, 410, and 430.</string>

			<string>Apple released the Apple IIc in April 1984, billing it as a portable Apple II, because it could be easily carried, though unlike modern portables it lacked a built-in display and battery. The IIc even sported a carrying handle that folded down to prop the machine up into a typing position. It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the Snow White design language, and the only one that used its unique creamy off-white color. The Apple IIc featured a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive and 128 KB RAM, with a built-in disk controller that could control external drives, composite video (NTSC or PAL), serial interfaces for modem and printer, and a port usable by either a joystick or mouse. Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all, this being the means by which its compact size was attained. Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1 MB of additional memory and a real-time clock into the machine, and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1 MB of RAM. The disk port, originally intended for a second 5.25-inch floppy drive, eventually was able to interface to 3.5-inch disk drives and (via third parties) even hard disks.</string>

			<string>The iPad 2 is Apple's 2nd generation iPad tablet, announced on March 2, 2011, and released in the United States on March 11, 2011. Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs revealed the device at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on March 2, 2011, despite his medical leave at the time. Alongside the iPad 2, Jobs also announced that the iOS 4.3 operating system would also be available March 9, 2011. The iPad 2 started selling on the Apple website on March 11. Apple introduced a new hardware design for its 2nd generation tablet, making it approximately 33 percent thinner than its predecessor. New standard features include a gyroscope, as well as front and rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video messaging—capable of messaging with iPhone 4, iPod Touch 4, and Mac OS X Snow Leopard devices. The iPad 2 also features an upgraded processor, a dual core Apple A5, which Apple claims is twice as fast as its predecessor for CPU operations, and up to 9 times as fast for GPU operations. In spite of a thinner design and more powerful processor, Apple claims to have retained the previous generation's advertised 10 hour battery life for the iPad 2. In addition to WiFi-only and AT&amp;T cellular data models available with 16, 32 and 64 GB of internal storage, the iPad 2 introduces a third tier of model with CDMA support for Verizon Wireless in the United States, available separately from the AT&amp;T capable version. With the option of white or black trim for all aforementioned models, this brings the total number of available models to 18, up from 6 for the previous generation. Apple also unveiled the Smart Cover, an accessory that attaches magnetically to the side of the device and protects the front of the device. Alongside the iPad 2, Jobs also announced that the iOS 4.3 operating system would be available March 11, 2011.</string>

			<string>The Silentype is Apple Inc.'s first printer, announced in 1979 and released in March 1980 $595 U.S., shortly after the Apple II Plus. The Silentype's firmware was written by Andy Hertzfeld, who later worked on the Macintosh. The Silentype is a thermal printer, which uses a special paper and provides 80 column output. It was also compatible with the Apple III. The Silentype printer needs its own specially designed interface card, or an Apple III with the built in Silentype port. It is mechanically identical to Trendcom's Model 200, except for the Apple logo in the lower left corner of the front cover, but the internal digital board was completely redesigned by Apple, removing the relatively expensive microprocessor and memory chips, relying on software in the Apple II instead.</string>

			<string>System 5 added MultiFinder, an add-on replacement for the Finder which could run several programs at once. Time was given to the background applications only when the foreground (or "running") applications gave it up (cooperative multitasking), but in fact most of them did via a clever change on the OS's event handling. The other significant change that System 5 brought to the Mac was Color QuickDraw, which debuted with the Macintosh II. This significantly altered the extent and design of the underlying graphics architecture (and its APIs), but it is a credit to Apple that most users, and perhaps more importantly existing code, were largely unaware of this. System 5 was also the first Macintosh operating system to be given a unified "Macintosh System Software" version number, as opposed to the numbers used for the System and Finder files.</string>

The Lisa was a more advanced system than the Macintosh of this time in many respects, such as its inclusion of protected memory, preemptive multitasking, a generally more sophisticated hard disk based operating system, a built-in screensaver, an advanced calculator with a paper tape and RPN, support for up to 2 megabytes (MB) of RAM, expansion slots, a numeric keypad, data corruption protection schemes such as block sparing, non-physical file names (with the ability to have multiple documents with the same name), and a larger higher-resolution display. It would be many years before many of those features were implemented on the Macintosh platform. Protected memory, for instance, didn't reappear until the Mac OS X operating system was released in 2001.</string>

			<string>The iPhone 6 was unveiled during an Apple Special Event on September 9, 2014, alongside the iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch. The iPhone 6 line marks the first major increases in physical screen size for the iPhone line since the taller screen of the iPhone 5, measuring at 4.7 inches. The design of the iPhone 6 line is influenced by that of the iPad Air, with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminium rear. Both models will come in gold, silver, and space gray finishes. It includes an Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5S. The main difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is the inclusion of a barometer to measure altitude changes. Apple touted that the A8 chip would provide, in comparison to the 5S, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. LTE support is expanded on the iPhone 6 line, with support for over 20 LTE bands (7 more than the iPhone 5S), up to 150 Mbps download speed, and VoLTE support. Wi-Fi performance has been improved with support for 802.11ac specifications, providing speeds up to 433 mbps—which is up to 3 times faster than 802.11n, along with Wi-Fi Calling support where available. The iPhone 6 line adds support for near-field communications (NFC), which is used primarily for Apple Pay—a new mobile payments system which will allow users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC. While still 8 megapixels in size, the iPhone 6 line’s rear-facing camera includes a new sensor containing larger pixels for better performance in low-light conditions, a f/2.2 aperture lens, and the ability to shoot 1080p video at either 30 or 60 frames per second. The iPhone 6 Plus adds support for optical image stabilization, while the iPhone 6 retains digital image stabilization. The front-facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f/2.2 aperture, along with support for burst and HDR modes.</string>

It was positioned as a high-end ultra-portable system, and Apple had to make some sacrifices to get it there: At 1.6 GHz (1.8 GHz BTO), it was slower than other contemporary Apple laptops, its 2 GB of RAM was non-upgradable, it had a smaller, slower hard drive, no firewire ports, no ethernet port, a single USB port, no optical audio output, no audio input, and, for the first time since the PowerBook 2400, no internal optical drive. There were sacrifices Apple did not make: the MacBook Air included a full-sized keyboard and screen, and an oversized trackpad, which supported many of the same multi-touch gestures introduced by the iPhone. To mitigate the connectivity and hardware tradeoffs necessary to make the MacBook Air so thin, Apple offered various accessories: an optional external 8x SuperDrive, a USB-to-ethernet adaptor, a USB 56kbps modem, and various micro-DVI adaptors. The MacBook Air shipped in a single retail configuration, with a 1.6 GHz dual-core processor, 2 GB of RAM, and an 80 GB hard drive, for $1799 U.S. BTO options included a 1.8 GHz processor ($200 U.S.), and a 64 GB solid-state drive ($999 U.S., later dropped to $599 U.S.)</string>

			<string>Mac OS 7.6 was the last major update to System 7, released in 1997. With 7.6, the operating system was officially called "Mac OS" instead of "System". Mac OS 7.6 introduced several features that were also included in Mac OS 8, including a revamped Extensions Manager, more native PowerPC code for Power Macs, more bundled Internet tools and utilities, and an overall more-stable Finder with increased memory allocation. In this version, the PowerTalk feature added in 7.5 was removed due to poor application support, and support for a large number of older Macintosh models was dropped. The minor update to Mac OS 7.6.1 finally ported the 68k exception handling routines to PowerPC, turning dreaded type 11 errors into less harmful errors (type 1, 2 or 3, usually) as crashing applications would more often terminate safely instead of crashing the operating system. Through this period, Apple had been attempting to release a completely new "modern" operating system, named Copland. When the Copland project was abandoned in 1996, Apple announced plans to release an OS update every six months until Rhapsody (which would by 2001 evolve into what was released as Mac OS X) shipped. Two more releases were shipped, now officially branded as the "Mac OS" — Mac OS 7.6 and the minor bug fix 7.6.1. Future versions were released as Mac OS 8–8.6 and Mac OS 9–9.2.</string>

			<string>The 10.4 release adds even more tools, applications, and services, some of which are derived from open source. Most notable additions are 64-bit application support, Access Control Lists, Xgrid, link aggregation, e-mail spam filtering (SpamAssassin), virus detection (ClamAV), Gateway Setup Assistant, and servers for Software Update, iChat Jabber server, and weblogs (Blojsom). 10.4 also has new client capabilities, as user identities can be fully independent of the client machine. The server can provide various levels of user management scenarios, including having client machines boot directly from an operating system stored on the server (NetBoot), booting independently but storing all user information on the server (network home directory), and/or storing the users' files locally on the users' portable computers while periodically synchronizing all user information to a mirror identity on the server (portable home directory). The end result of these technologies is that users can access some or all of their complete computer identity from any location and/or from any computer on the internet. In typical Apple style, these services are all configured with a small number of graphical-interface configurators.</string>

			<string>Introduced on October 15, 1990, the Macintosh Classic was the first Apple Macintosh to sell for less than US$1,000. Production of the Classic was prompted by the success of the Macintosh Plus and the Macintosh SE. The system specifications of the Classic were very similar to its predecessors, with the same 9-inch (23 cm) monochrome CRT display, 512×384 pixel resolution, and 4 megabyte (MB) memory limit of the older Macintosh computers. Apple's decision to not update the Classic with newer technology such as a 68010 CPU, higher RAM capacity or color display ensured compatibility with the Mac's by-then healthy software base as well as enabled it to fit the lower price Apple intended for it. Nevertheless, the Classic featured several improvements over the aging Macintosh Plus, which it replaced as Apple's low-end Mac computer. It was up to 25 percent faster than the Plus and included an Apple SuperDrive 3.5-inch (9 cm) floppy disk drive as standard. The Classic was an adaptation of the 1984 Macintosh 128K industrial design, as had been the earlier Macintosh SE. Apple released two versions that ranged in price from $1,000 to $1,500. Reviewer reactions were mixed; most focused on the slow processor performance and lack of expansion slots. The consensus was that the Classic was only useful for word processing, spreadsheets and databases. The price and the availability of education software led to the Classic's popularity in education. It was sold alongside the more powerful Macintosh Classic II in 1991 until its discontinuation the next year.</string>

			<string>The PowerMac G4 (AGP Graphics) was a major revision of the PowerMac line. Based on the Unified logic board Architecture, the G4 AGP introduced a number of performance improvements. Improvements included AGP-based graphics, AirPort compatibility, a faster memory bus, DVD-ROM or RAM standard, an internal FireWire port, 2 separate USB buses for a combined 24 Mbs, a 2X (133 MHz) AGP slot, and up to 1.5 GB of RAM. The G4 AGP started at $2499 U.S. for the 450 MHz configuration with a 20 GB hard drive and 128 MB of RAM, and $3499 U.S. for the 500 MHz configuration with a 27 GB hard drive and 256 MB or RAM (both included internal Zip drives). There were extreme supply issues with the G4 initially, due largely to Motorola's inability to deliver the 7400 chips in adequate supply. This was further compounded by an "errata" in the initial revision of the 7400 that effectively lowered the ceiling of the chip to 450 MHz. As a result, all models of the G4 were "speed dumped" in October. The $2499 U.S. 450 MHz model was lowered in speed to 400 MHz, and the $3499 U.S. 500 MHz model was lowered to 450 MHz. The price, and all other specs were the same. A 350 MHz configuration was subsequently added to replace the similar G4 (PCI Graphics) configuration a month later, and the whole line was speed-bumped back up to 400/450/500 MHz in February 2000.</string>

			<string>The first of a new breed, the idea behind the Duo 210 was to have a fully functional desktop computer (by way of the DuoDock) that also served as an excellent portable machine. The 210 ran on a 25 MHz 68030 processor, had a 4-bit passive screen, 4-32 MB of memory, and an internal hard drive. Its most innovative feature was the 152 pin PDS that allowed it to dock with a docking station that might contain more RAM, a larger hard drive, or more VRAM for a color monitor. The 210 cost $2,250 U.S., and was discontinued in October 1993.</string>

			<string>The PowerBook G3 was the first PowerBook to use the PPC 750, a third generation Motorola/IBM processor. The 750, or "G3" as it had been nicknamed before, was the first PPC processor designed to use a high speed, "backside" cache which could interact with the processor at much faster speeds than a standard L2 cache, which was restricted by the logic board speed. The PowerBook G3 was similar to the PowerBook 3400, with the addition of a 750 processor running at 250MHz, and a 512k backside cache running at a 2.5:1 processor to cache ratio (100MHz). The Power of the 750, combined with the high speed cache, made the PowerBook G3 the fastest notebook in the world, bar none (It clocked speeds nearly as fast as the 9600/300).</string>

Variants of the user installable AirPort Extreme Card are marked A-1010 (early North American spec), A-1026 (current North American spec), A-1027 (Europe/Asia spec (additional channels)) and A-1095 (unknown). A different 802.11g card was included in the last iteration of the PowerPC-based PowerBooks and iBooks. A major distinction for this card was that it was the first "combo" card that included both 802.11g as well as Bluetooth.</string>

			<string>Mac OS X Server 1.0, released in 1999, was the first operating system released by Apple Computer based on their acquisition of NeXT. Although it had the Platinum "look and feel" from Mac OS 8 it was based on the NEXTSTEP operating system instead of the classic Mac OS, giving users a preview of the future operating system Mac OS X. Server 1.0 was a mix of features from the classic Mac OS, NEXTSTEP and Mac OS X. It had a single menu bar across the top of the screen like Mac OS but file management was performed in Workspace Manager from NEXTSTEP instead of the Mac's Finder. The user interface still used the Display PostScript based window server from NEXTSTEP, instead of the Display PDF based WindowServer which would appear a year later in Mac OS X Public Beta. Windows with unsaved content had the black dot in the window close button like NEXTSTEP. It did not have the Dock or the Aqua appearance that were later added to Mac OS X. Server 1.0 also included the first version of a NetBoot server. To run classic Mac OS applications, Mac OS X Server 1.0 included the "Blue Box" which essentially ran a copy of Mac OS 8.5.1 in a separate process as an emulation layer. This became the "Classic Environment" in Mac OS X, though it was no longer Mac OS 8.5.1 being run, but the latest version of Mac OS 9.</string>

			<string>The iPod was a hard disk based digital music player that was smaller than most portable tape decks. The iPod could compete with both flash-based and hard disk based players: By using a 1.8" hard disk, Apple was able to make the iPod smaller than most other hard disk MP3 players, small enough to go up against flash-based players, whose capacity was more than an order of magnitude less than the 5 GB available on the iPod. The 5 GB iPod was priced at $399 U.S. In March 2002, Apple added a 10 GB model to its iPod lineup, for $499 U.S. Several months later, in July 2002, Apple replaced the mechanical scroll wheel with a solid-state touch wheel, added a $499 U.S. 20 GB model, and dropped the prices of the 5 and 10 GB models to $299 U.S. and $399 U.S., respectively (The 5 GB iPod kept its mechanical scroll wheel). In addition, Apple for the first time made iPods available to Windows users.</string>

			<string>Announced in January 2001, the PowerBook G4 was a dramatic change to Apple's PowerBook line. Based on a new low-power G4 chip, the PPC 7410, the PowerBook G4 sported a stylish new Titanium enclosure, which was only 1" thick, .7" thinner than its predecessor, the PowerBook (FireWire). The reduction in size came at a price, however: the PB G4 had a fixed, 6x slot-load DVD-ROM drive instead of a removable drive bay, and a single battery bay (previous models allowed the use of the drive bay as a second battery bay). The most innovative feature of the PowerBook G4, was its wide-aspect 15.2" screen, which had a native resolution of 1152x768. This made the PB G4 wider than its predecessor, but it was over an inch less deep. The PowerBook G4 shipped in two configurations. The 400 MHz model, with 128 MB of RAM and a 10 GB hard drive was $2,599 U.S. (a $100 U.S. increase in the low-end model price), and the 500 MHz model, with 256 MB of RAM and a 20 GB hard drive was $3,499 U.S. In mid-2001, These prices were reduced to $2,199 U.S. and $2,999 U.S., respectively.</string>

The display features a built-in HD FaceTime camera, microphone, and dual speaker system. A MagSafe cable runs from the back of the display for charging notebooks, as does a Thunderbolt cable. There is also a separate Thunderbolt port, a FireWire 800 port, 3 USB 2.0 ports, and a gigabit Ethernet port. As the Cinema Display before it, it uses LED backlighting, though it now features a Thunderbolt port cable (an upgrade from the standard Mini DisplayPort before it) for video input. This display is only officially compatible with Macs that have the Thunderbolt connector. A third-party converter must be used in order to use this display with older Macs. The display supports daisy chaining of two Thunderbolt Displays from a MacBook Pro.</string>

			<string>In 1990, Apple decided to offer entry-level LaserWriter printers and released the Personal LaserWriter series. The Personal LaserWriter series was targeted at home computer users or small businesses. They were of lower quality but therefore rather inexpensive. Apple shipped the first Personal LaserWriter (Personal LaserWriter SC) without a CPU, but later models shipped with AMD processors. Later the Personal LaserWriter series even supported LocalTalk networking, it never supported ethernet networking, though.</string>

			<string>In February 2005, the second-generation iPod mini came on the market with a new 6 GB model at $249 U.S. and an updated 4 GB model priced at $199 U.S. Most notably, both models featured an increased battery life of up to 18 hours. In addition, they featured richer case colors (though Apple discontinued the gold color) and other minor aesthetic changes (the color of the lettering on the Click Wheel now matched the color of the iPod mini). Also, the 2G iPod minis did not include the AC adapter or the FireWire cable bundled with previous models. With the introduction of the iPod nano, the iPod mini was discontinued.</string>

			<string>OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8) is the ninth major release of OS X. OS X Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012. It gains features from iOS, such as Notes and Reminders as applications separate from Mail and Calendar, in addition to those iOS features introduced in Mac OS X Lion. OS X Mountain Lion replaces iChat with Messages, which includes support for iMessage, allowing users to send unlimited messages to other Macs (running 10.8 or later), iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches (running iOS 5 or later). It also includes the latest version of the Safari web browser, Safari 6. Another feature from iOS 6 included in Mountain Lion is Notification Center, a sidebar pane that provides an overview of alerts from applications. It displays notifications until the user completes an associated action, rather than requiring instant resolution. OS X Mountain Lion received positive reviews, with critics praising Notification Center, Messages, and speed improvements over Mac OS X Lion, and criticizing Game Center for lack of games. Mountain Lion sold 3 million units in the first four days, making it Apple's most successful Mac release to date.</string>

			<string>System 7.1 introduced the new Fonts folder, allowing users to organize their fonts in the Finder. This was previously done in System 6 with an application called Font/DA Mover. The first major upgrade was System 7.1.1, also known as System 7 Pro. This release was basically a bundle of 7.1 with AppleScript tools, QuickTime and Apple Open Collaboration Environment (AOCE). While System 7 had troubles running in slightly older machines due to memory footprint, System 7 Pro would barely fit into even the most "loaded" machines of the era. Most users installed it for various minor fixes, ignoring the new functionality. Soon after the release of System 7, Apple joined the AIM alliance and started work on PowerPC-based machines that would later become the Power Macintosh series. Support for these machines resulted in System 7.1.2, which also included a number of fixes and new features. This was followed quite quickly with System 7.1.3, primarily a bug-fix release.</string>

			<string>Announced on the last day of January in 2005, the PowerBook G4 (1.5-1.67 GHz, was essentially a speed-bump of the existing PowerBook G4 line, with modest feature improvements on the low and middle-end models. The PowerBook G4 shipped in five configurations. There were two 12.1" models, both with 1.5 GHz processors and 512 MB of RAM: the Combo Drive model, with a 60 GB hard drive, sold for $1,499 U.S. and the SuperDrive model, with an 80 GB hard drive, sold for $1,699 U.S. There were also two 15.2" models, both with 512 MB of RAM, an 80 GB hard drive and an illuminated keyboard: the 1.5 GHz Combo Drive model was $1,999 U.S.; the SuperDrive model, with a 1.67 GHz processor, was $2,299 U.S. There was a single, high-end 17" model, with 512 MB of RAM, a 100 GB hard drive, twice the VRAM, a dual-link DVI port and a SuperDrive, for $2,699 U.S.</string>

			<string>It took Apple over a year to upgrade the original Newton. The main reason was that the Newton team had worked hard for over 6 years and after the devastating press of the original Message Pad morale was low. The first revisions were Newton Message Pad 100 and 110. While the MP 100 was basically the original Message Pad with a new ROM, the MP 110 had a new design with a smaller screen and longer-lasting batteries. The Message Pad 130, released in early 1996 at CeBit in Germany, was the first Message Pad to feature an optional backlit display for better readability.</string>

			<string>Apple worked on the new System for almost a year before releasing it to the public. The bulk of the work was done on the Finder, which jumped from version 1.1 to 4.1, while the System only went up to 2.0. The Finder was now much faster than ever before and jam packed with new features. Users could create a new folder using the New Folder command, which replaced the Empty Folder method. Users could now change the view of the folder for the first time to "List", which created little tiny icons next to their corresponding filenames. Users could also print the list using Print Catalog, a new command under the File menu. The Chooser's predecessor, Choose Printer, made a home in the Apple menu. Users were also now able to shut down their OS using the command in the Special menu. Disks could be ejected by dragging them to the Trash. MiniFinder also debuted in the Special menu. It allowed users to pick their favorite applications, so when they quit one, a dialog box would appear with icons of all the other ones that they had selected. This was similar to Launcher or At Ease.</string>

			<string>Introduced in June 2009, the MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2009) replaced the MacBook (13-inch, Aluminum, Late 2008). Apple chose to "upgrade" the name to include Pro because of several key improvements, felt to be professional-level features. These included a FireWire800 port, an SD card slot (an Apple first), an improved LED-backlit screen, and a backlit keyboard on all models. The MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2009) also included the integrated battery introduced with the MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2009).

			<string>When it was announced in February 1997, The PowerBook 3400 was the fastest portable computer in the world. After several years of PowerBook trouble, Apple hoped to revitalize its portable market share with this new PCI-based model. Its drive bay was compatible with the older 5300 model, and it was the first PowerBook to utilize the 1 MB IrDA Infra-red standard. The 3400 ranged from $4,500 U.S. for 180 MHz and no CD-ROM to $6,500 for 240 MHz, fully loaded. (The 240 MHz model was announced at the same time as the slower models, but shipped several months later.)</string>

			<string>The iMac G5 brought G5 muscle to Apple's consumer desktop line. Housed in a completely new enclosure reminiscent of Apple's Cinema Display line, the iMac G5 was a marvel of miniaturization. The case was only two inches thick, yet housed a machine considerably faster and more advanced than its G4-based predecessor. In addition to a 64-bit G5 processor, the iMac G5 also included a much faster memory bus, better graphics for the low-end model, twice the hard drive space for the high-end model, and a new audio port which doubled as an optical digital audio output. The iMac G5 was initially available in three configurations: 17" LCD/1.6 GHz/80 GB hard drive/256 MB of RAM/Combo drive/$1299 U.S., 17" LCD/1.8 GHz/80 GB hard drive/256 MB of RAM/SuperDrive/$1499 U.S., and 20" LCD/1.8 GHz/160 GB hard drive/256 MB of RAM/SuperDrive/$1899 U.S.</string>

			<string>Announced in February 2001, this revision of the iMac finally brought FireWire to Apple's entire product line, in addition to a dramatic change in the iMac "colors". Apple chose to get rid of Sage and Ruby in favor of "Blue Dalmatian" and "Flower Power", two new patterns that were molded into the case using a technique which took Apple 18 months to perfect. The higher-end model iMac got a CD-RW drive, an improved (and faster) PPC 750cx processor, which featured an on-chip 1:1 L2 cache, and a speedy new graphics chip (the 750cx and new graphics chip were initially only available on non-North American models.). It featured a 500 MHz processor, 64 MB of RAM, a 20 GB hard drive and a 56 kbps modem, was available in Indigo, Blue Dalmatian or Flower Power, and was priced at $1199 U.S. The low-end iMac was essentially a renamed iMac DV (Summer 2000), with the price cut to $899 U.S. It had a 400 MHz processor, 64 MB of RAM, a 10 GB hard drive and a 56 kbps modem, and was available only in Indigo.</string>

			<string>The entire System shipped on a 400 KB disk with the first Macintosh 128k models, and also included a separate tutorial disk that taught you how to use the mouse called Mousing Around, which later became Mac Basics. Even though it was a breakthrough in interface design, System 1.0 also had many headaches and inconsistencies. Most apparent was the copying of disks, which could take up to 20 minutes and countless disk swaps (partly due to the Mac's limited memory). Rebuilding the desktop back then removed all your folders, putting all files at the root level of your disk. Also, the tutorial was incompatible with System 1.0, and a patched version of the System had to be included with the tutorial disk to avoid crashing. You also could not create a new folder. Instead, an folder named "Empty Folder" always existed on the root level of any Mac-formatted disk. When you renamed it, a new "Empty Folder" would appear.</string>

			<string>Time Capsule is a wireless network-attached storage device made by Apple Inc. It is marketed as a backup device, designed to work in tandem with the Time Machine back-up utility, introduced in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. The device includes a full AirPort Extreme Base Station (with 802.11n wireless, an Ethernet WAN port and three Ethernet LAN ports). Storage is provided by, according to Apple, a "server-grade" hard drive. In early 2009, Apple released a newer model offering simultaneous 802.11n dual-band operation to allow older devices to use the slower wireless speeds without affecting the overall performance of devices that can use the higher 802.11n speeds. Also released in this new version is Guest Networking which allows guests to sign on with a different password to ensure your private network is kept private.</string>

"iMessage" is an application that allows iPod touch, iPhone, and iPad users to communicate, much like a chat service only used between these devices. The iMessage feature has been integrated into the "Messages" application on the iPhone. The iPod application on the iPhone and iPad has now been split into the Music and Video application, just as it had been on the iPod touch. iOS 5 also brings long-awaited Hindi virtual keyboard. According to Apple, the new OS has over 200 new features.</string>

			<string>Introduced in June 2010, the iPhone 4 replaced the iPhone 3GS, and included the same Apple-designed A4 processor found in the iPad. External improvements included a slimmer, redesigned case, a 5 megapixel camera with LED flash, a VGA-quality front-facing camera, and a stunning new 960x640 LED-backlit display. Apple claimed that the new display, branded the "Retina display," was so high-resolution that at at standard reading distances, the human eye would be unable to distinguish individual pixels. Under-the-hood improvements included the aforementioned A4 processor, a faster graphics subsystem, improved battery life, and a 3-axis gyroscope which, when combined with the existing accelerometer, provided 6-axis motion detection. The iPhone 4 included the newly re-branded iOS 4.0, which brought a number of improvements, including multitasking and folders. In addition, the iPhone 4 included a new video calling feature, called "FaceTime," and the capability for 720p 30 fps HD video recording and editing.</string>

			<string>Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version 10.6) is the seventh major release of Mac OS X. Snow Leopard was publicly unveiled on June 8, 2009 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. On August 28, 2009, it was released worldwide, and was made available for purchase from Apple's website and its retail stores at the price of $29 U.S. for a single-user license. Unlike those of previous versions of Mac OS X, the goals of Snow Leopard were improved performance, greater efficiency and the reduction of its overall memory footprint. Much of the software in Mac OS X was extensively rewritten for this release in order to take advantage fully of modern Macintosh hardware. New programming frameworks, such as OpenCL, were created, allowing software developers to use graphics cards in their applications. This is also the first Mac OS release since System 7.1.1 that does not support Macs using PowerPC processors, as Apple now intends to focus on its current line of Intel-based products. As support for Rosetta was dropped in OS X Lion, Snow Leopard is the last version of Mac OS X that is able to run PowerPC-only applications.</string>

It was based on the Developer Preview 4 (DP4) of OS X and was still very buggy. However, it demonstrated the strength of Apple's new system software like the new Aqua interface or the Quartz drawing engine. It was sold for $29.95 U.S. at the Apple Store and was available in English, German and French. The Public Beta still had the Apple logo in center of the menu bar, but due to many user complaints, Apple moved the Apple logo back to its original place on the left side of the menu.</string>

			<string>iPhone 4s is the fifth generation of the iPhone, a device that combines a widescreen iPod with a touchscreen, mobile phone, and internet communicator. It retains the exterior design of its predecessor, iPhone 4, but is host to a range of improved hardware specifications and software updates compared to the previous model. Integrated software and hardware changes support the introduction of new user interface and functions by Apple. Highlights include a voice recognizing and talking assistant called Siri, personal computer independence, cloud-sourced data (iCloud) and an improved camera system. A selection of the device's functions can be controlled by voice. The iPhone 4s was unveiled at Apple's Let's Talk iPhone event on October 4, 2011 in Cupertino, California. Apple started taking pre-orders for the iPhone 4s on October 7, 2011 in seven initial countries (United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan) with a first delivery date set for October 14, 2011, and available on that same day for direct store sales in those countries. It was released in 22 more European, American and Asian countries, including Ireland, Mexico and Singapore on October 28.</string>

The device comes with the same 326 pixels per inch found in the iPhone 4 and 4S. The iPhone 5 has the SoC A6 processor, the chip is 22 percent smaller than the iPhone 4s’ A5 and is twice as fast, doubling the graphics performance of its predecessor. The device is 18 percent thinner than the iPhone 4s, measuring 7.6mm, and is 20 percent lighter at 112 grams. The iPhone 5, as well as the iPod Touch (5th generation), and iPod Nano (7th generation), feature a new dock connector named Lightning, which replaces the 30-pin Apple Dock connector introduced in 2003 by Apple on the iPod (3rd generation). The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signalling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one, helping the iPhone 5 to be slimmer than its predecessors. Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way round. Various accessories will be available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older 30-pin Apple Dock connector or USB.</string>

			<string>Apple released the third generation of MacBook Pro in June 2012 as a 15-inch screen size only. At the same time, slightly updated versions of the previous 13- and 15-inch unibody models were announced that will sell in parallel. While dimensionally smaller than its predecessor, the similarly styled third generation model still retains a unibody form factor. Specification-wise, the most substantial differences in the next-generation MacBook Pro are the fitting of a significantly higher resolution Retina display, the elimination of the optical drive, and replacement of hard disk drives with solid-state drives. A third generation 13-inch MacBook Pro was released on October 23, 2012. As with the 15-inch, it includes a Retina display.</string>

			<string>On June 11, 2012, at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco Apple introduced a new third generation MacBook Pro, marketed as the "MacBook Pro with Retina display" to differentiate it from the updated models of the previous generation released earlier that day. The new model includes an Ivy Bridge chipset with USB 3.0, and a high-resolution 15.4" 2880x1800-pixel Retina display. Other new or changed features include a second Thunderbolt port, an HDMI port, and a thinner MagSafe 2 adapter. The new model omits Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports, though Apple announced Thunderbolt adapters for both interfaces along with its release. It also omits a SuperDrive, making it Apple's first professional notebook since the PowerBook 2400c to ship without a built-in optical drive. The new model ships with a solid state drive standard rather than a hard drive. Apple also claims improved speakers and microphones and a new system for cooling the notebook with improved fans. The Retina display MacBook Pro largely follows the styling of the previous generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys. The power button is now located on the keyboard rather than the upper right corner of the chassis. At 0.71 inches (18 mm) thick it is 25 percent thinner than its predecessor. The screen has a thinner bezel, and the model's name is now on the underside of the chassis rather than the bottom of the bezel.</string>

			<string>The iPad 2 is Apple's 2nd generation iPad tablet, announced on March 2, 2011, and released in the United States on March 11, 2011. Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs revealed the device at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on March 2, 2011, despite his medical leave at the time. Alongside the iPad 2, Jobs also announced that the iOS 4.3 operating system would also be available March 9, 2011. The iPad 2 started selling on the Apple website on March 11. Apple introduced a new hardware design for its 2nd generation tablet, making it approximately 33 percent thinner than its predecessor. New standard features include a gyroscope, as well as front and rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video messaging—capable of messaging with iPhone 4, iPod Touch 4, and Mac OS X Snow Leopard devices. The iPad 2 also features an upgraded processor, a dual core Apple A5, which Apple claims is twice as fast as its predecessor for CPU operations, and up to 9 times as fast for GPU operations. In spite of a thinner design and more powerful processor, Apple claims to have retained the previous generation's advertised 10 hour battery life for the iPad 2. In addition to WiFi-only and AT&amp;T cellular data models available with 16, 32 and 64 GB of internal storage, the iPad 2 introduces a third tier of model with CDMA support for Verizon Wireless in the United States, available separately from the AT&amp;T capable version. With the option of white or black trim for all aforementioned models, this brings the total number of available models to 18, up from 6 for the previous generation. Apple also unveiled the Smart Cover, an accessory that attaches magnetically to the side of the device and protects the front of the device. Alongside the iPad 2, Jobs also announced that the iOS 4.3 operating system would be available March 11, 2011.</string>

			<string>Apple's solution to having had 4 products named the PowerBook G3, was to drop the G3 altogether. The PowerBook (FireWire) finally brought the "Unified logic board Architecture" (UMA) to the professional PowerBook line. The PowerBook (FireWire) finally replaced the SCSI port, with dual 400 MBit/s FireWire ports. Its bus speed was upped to 100MHz, and it included an AGP-based ATI Rage 128 graphics chipset, and a 6X DVD-ROM drive. The PowerBook G3 (FireWire) came in two configurations: the 400 MHz/64MB/6GB model was initially sold for $2,499 U.S., and the 500 MHz/128MB/12GB model was $3,499 U.S. In September 2000 the hard drive sizes were increased to 10 and 20 GB, respectively.</string>

			<string>Mac OS 8.5 was the first version of the Mac OS to run solely on Macs equipped with a PowerPC processor. As such it replaced some but not all of the m68k code with PowerPC code, improving system performance by relying less on 680x0 emulation. Parties interested in such things have noted that there are still many strings in the System file which make references to obsolete 68K machinery. It was the first version to include the Sherlock search utility. Sherlock allowed users to search the contents of documents on hard drives (given that it had an index of your hard drive), or extend a search to the Internet. Sherlock plug-ins started appearing at this time; these plug-ins allowed you to search the contents of other websites. Mac OS 8.5 included a number of performance improvements. Copying files over a network was faster than previous versions and Apple advertised it as being "faster than Windows NT". AppleScript was also re-written to use only PowerPC code, which significantly improved AppleScript execution speed. Mac OS 8.5 was the first version of the Mac OS to support "themes," or skins, which could change the default Apple Platinum look of the Mac OS to "Gizmo" or "HiTech." This radical changing of the computer's appearance was removed at the last minute, and appeared only in the beta. In addition to the themes support, 8.5 was the first version to support 32-bit icons.</string>

			<string>Apple unveiled a completely redesigned Mac Pro during the WWDC 2013 keynote. Apple Senior Vice President of Marketing Phil Schiller presented a "sneak peek" video of the product. The video revealed an overhauled case design, a polished silver aluminum cylinder built around a central thermal dissipation core and vented by a single fan, which pulls air from under the case, through the core, and out the top of the case. The model is assembled in Austin, Texas. The Mac Pro (Late 2013) has a vastly redesigned configuration of ports. The Mac Pro has an HDMI 1.4 port, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, six Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 3 ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / analog 1⁄8" stereo mini jacks for sound in and out. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to 36 Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can support up to 3 simultaneous 4k displays. This design requires 2 GPUs to support the 7 display outputs (HDMI and 6 Thunderbolt). The new Mac Pro no longer has FireWire 800 ports, dedicated digital audio in/out ports, a SuperDrive, or a DVI port (although DVI devices can easily be attached using an HDMI-to-DVI adapter). The new Mac Pro removes the ability to replace hard drives by foregoing the four 3.5-inch drive bays for proprietary PCIe-channel flash storage. It also removes the ability to add PCIe cards internally, leaving the RAM as the only user-serviceable part. The I/O panel is illuminated when the unit senses it has been moved to make it easier for the user to see the ports.</string>

			<string>At the Apple Let's Rock Event on September 9, 2008, the iPod nano 4th Generation was officially announced. It returns to the narrow form factor of the 2G model, while retaining and rotating the 2-inch (51 mm) screen from the 3G model. It is also thinner than both the 2G and 3G, measuring 90.7 mm (3.6 inches) tall by 38.7 mm (1.5 inches) wide by 6.2 mm (0.24 inch) thick, and weighing 36.8 grams (1.3 ounces). It has a curved aluminum shell and glass screen. The six previous colors (silver, charcoal, mint, turquoise, berry red, and rose pink) have been replaced by silver, black, purple, light blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and pink. Apple markets the new colors as "nano-chromatic". Also added is an accelerometer which allows the nano to switch between portrait and landscape display modes by just tilting the iPod left or right, shuffle songs when shaken, and access Cover Flow when tilted sideways. Also you must turn the Nano sideways to watch videos. The UI has also been refreshed, adding a more stylized look in keeping with the new hardware design. It includes a new voice recording feature which starts automatically when an Apple compatible microphone is plugged in. It also includes the new "Genius" feature, introduced by Apple the same day. The Genius feature automatically creates playlists based on a selected song using an algorithm built by Apple. It is additionally touted as "the most environmentally friendly iPod Apple has ever made", containing arsenic-free glass and a BFR-, mercury-, and PVC-free design. It is also claimed to be highly recyclable. The iPod Nano 4G will be shipped in cases similar to the 2G ones with the clear view in the front, and is marketed in two models: 8 GB and 16 GB. Limited quantities of an unannounced 4 GB model have surfaced in various markets.</string>

			<string>A radical departure from the existing Apple II line, the IIGS featured a true 16-bit microprocessor, the 65C816, operating at 2.8 MHz with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8 MB of RAM without the bank-switching hassles of the earlier machines. It introduced two completely new graphic modes sporting higher resolutions and a palette of 4,096 colors; however, only 4 (at 640×200 resolution) or 16 (at 320×200 resolution) colors could be used on a single line at a time. The Apple IIGS stood out from any previous (or future) Apple II models, evolving and advancing the platform into the next generation of computing while still maintaining near-complete backward compatibility. The secret of the Apple IIGS's compatibility was a single chip called the Mega II, which contained the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer (sans processor). This, combined with the flawless 65C02 emulation mode of the 65C816 processor, provided full support for legacy software. The computer also included a 32-voice Ensoniq 5503, 'wavetable' sample-based music synthesizer chip with 64 KB dedicated RAM, 256 KB of standard RAM, built-in peripheral ports (switchable between IIe-style card slots and IIc-style onboard controllers for disk drives, mouse, RGB video, and serial devices), built-in AppleTalk networking, and a ROM toolbox that supported a graphical user interface derived from the Macintosh toolbox. The computer could run existing 8-bit Apple II software (including software written for the very first Apple II in Integer BASIC), but also supported 16-bit software running under a new OS first called ProDOS 16 and later called GS/OS. The new OS eventually included a Finder that could be used for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications, along with desk accessories – just like the Macintosh. The 16-bit operating system would automatically switch to the text display and downshift to 8-bit mode to run legacy software, while offering a consistent, Macintosh-like graphical interface for native 16-bit applications. Eventually, the IIGS gained the ability to read and write Macintosh disks and, through third-party software, even multitasking (both cooperative and preemptive, the latter in the form of a Unix-type shell), outline TrueType font support, and in one case, even real-time 3D gaming using texture mapping. The first 50,000 Apple IIGS computers came with Steve Wozniak's "Woz" signature silkscreened on the front and were referred to as the "Woz Limited Edition".</string>

			<string>OS X Yosemite was announced and released to developers on June 2, 2014, at Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2014 and it was released to public beta testers on July 24, 2014. Yosemite was released to consumers on October 16, 2014. Following the California landmark-based naming scheme introduced with OS X Mavericks, Yosemite is named after the national park. Yosemite introduced a major revision to the operating system's user interface, designed with inspiration from iOS 7, while still maintaining the OS X desktop metaphor. The interface incorporates a flatter visual appearance with blurred translucency effects. Other notable design changes include new icons, light and dark color schemes, and the replacement of Lucida Grande with Helvetica Neue as the default system font. The dock is now a 2D translucent rectangle instead of a skeuomorphic glass shelf, reminiscent of the dock design used in early versions of OS X through Tiger. Many of Yosemite's new features focus on the theme of continuity, increasing its integration with other Apple services and platforms such as iOS and iCloud. The Handoff functionality allows the operating system to integrate with iOS 8 devices over Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi; users can place and answer phone calls to and from an iPhone using their Mac as a speakerphone, send and receive text messages, activate personal hotspots, or load items being worked on in a mobile app (such as Mail drafts or Numbers spreadsheets) directly into their desktop equivalent.</string>

			<string>The Xserve marked Apple's first major push into the server market since its ill-fated Network Servers. While Apple had sold server versions of various Power Macs, the Xserve was the first Apple machine specifically designed for the server market in years. The most remarkable feature of the Xserve was its rackmount case. Just 1U (1.75") thick, The Xserve case was a remarkable feat of engineering. The four drive bays were accessible via the front panel, as was one of the firewire ports, and the CD-ROM drive. Multicolored display lights on the front panel showed drive access, processor load, and ethernet link status. The Xserve was targeted at the Enterprise and Educational server markets, and was available in two configurations. The low-end model, with a single 1.0 GHz processor, a 60 GB hard drive, and 256 MB of RAM was $2999 U.S. The high-end model, with dual 1.0 GHz processors, 512 MB of RAM, and a 60 GB hard drive was $3999 U.S.</string>

			<string>At WWDC 2003, Apple announced Mac OS X 10.3 Panther. Panther introduced lots of new features such as new window management Exposé, improved Finder, AES-128 encryption for personal files, enhanced version of Preview, faxing, faster Mail, and Font Book; a font management tool. Also, the iDisk access and synchronization was significantly improved. However, two new features got most attention: Fast User Switching and Xcode. Fast User Switching was one of the most eagerly awaited features that enabled users who shared a Mac to switch between accounts without quitting applications and logging out. Because of the graphic power of Mac OS X, the switching between users was animated by transforming the current desktop to a 3D Cube and rotating it to the new account. Xcode was a new development tool for Mac OS X applications. It improved the speed of compiling applications significantly, for instance by distributing compile workload across idle computers on a network. Panther was sold for $129 U.S.</string>

			<string>The iPad Air is the fifth generation iPad. Unveiled during a keynote on October 22, 2013, the iPad Air features the 64-bit Apple A7 processor along with a M7 coprocessor. The iPad Air marks the first major design change for the iPad since the iPad 2; it now features a thinner design that is 7.5 millimetres thick and has a smaller screen bezel similar to the iPad mini. Apple reduced the overall volume for the iPad Air by using thinner components resulting in a 25% reduction in weight over the iPad 2. Though it still uses the same 9.7-inch Retina display as the previous iPad model, an improved front-facing camera makes using FaceTime much clearer. The new front facing camera is capable of video in 720p HD, includes face detection, and backside illumination. The rear camera received an upgrade as well; now being called the iSight camera, in addition to the same functions as the front camera it also contains a 5MP CCD, hybrid IR filter and a fixed ƒ/2.4 aperture.</string>

			<string>The "Bronze Keyboard" PowerBook G3 series was announced in May 1999. It included several improvements to the previous PowerBook G3, including the addition of on-board USB, and the option of an on-board MPEG-2 decoder. The big news, however, was that the "Bronze" was 20 percent thinner than its predecessor, nearly two pounds lighter, and boasted significantly longer battery life. The "Bronze Keyboard" PowerBook G3 came in two configurations: the 333 MHz was initially sold for $2,499 U.S., and the 400 MHz model was $3,499 U.S. Although Steve Jobs originally announced a May 20 shipping date, few units shipped before mid-June.</string>

			<string>The Magic Mouse is the first consumer mouse to have multi-touch capabilities. Taking after the iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and multi-touch trackpads, the Magic Mouse allows the use of gestures such as swiping and scrolling across the top surface of the mouse to interact with desktop computers. It connects via Bluetooth and runs on two AA batteries. The mouse requires at least Mac OS X 10.5.8. It can be configured as a two-buttoned left-handed or right-handed mouse, but the default is a single button. It uses laser tracking for increased pointer accuracy over previous generation Apple mice. Since its release, it has been included along with a wireless keyboard with the 2009 generation of iMacs, and with a wired keyboard with the 2010 Mac Pro workstations. It can also be purchased separately.</string>

			<string>The iPod nano represented a bold decision for Apple: to replace the best-selling iPod mini, at the height of its market dominance, with a brand-new, significantly different iPod model. Whereas the mini had been based around a 1" hard drive, the iPod nano was built around a 2 or 4 GB flash memory drive. The iPod nano's look and feel was more aesthetically aligned with that of the iPod color than the mini's had been. It also included a higher-resolution color screen, which, along with the remarkable decrease in physical size, helped to justify the reduction in capacity. Although the nano held fewer songs per dollar than its predecessor, Apple sold the 2 and 4 GB nano models at the same price point as the previous 4 and 6 GB mini models: $199 and $249 U.S., respectively.</string>

			<string>The LC II was essentially an upgrade of the original LC. Unfortunately, while Apple "speed-bumped" the processor to a 16 MHz 68030, they kept the 16-bit data path, making the speed improvement minimal (the 68030 was a 32-bit processor). The LC II sold for $1240 U.S., making it one of the more affordable Macs ever. It was discontinued in March 1993, when it was replaced by the LC III. In September 1992, it was bundled with several different hard drives and software, and re-released as the Performa 400, 405, 410, and 430.</string>

			<string>The third generation iPod Shuffle was released on March 11, 2009 and is said by Apple to be "jaw-droppingly small" and "The first music player that talks to you" with dimensions of 45.2 x 17.5 x 7.8 mm (1.8 x 0.7 x 0.3 in). It is available with a silver or black brushed aluminum case similar to the second generation iPod Shuffle. This makes it the first iPod Shuffle that is available in black – although the black is more of a dark grey, especially in comparison to the black iPod Touch. It features VoiceOver technology that allows song names, artist names, album names and playlist contents and names to be spoken in 14 different languages using the Text-to-Speech incorporated in iTunes 8. It also has gained support for multiple playlists, in contrast to previous versions of the iPod Shuffle, which allowed only a single playlist. The third generation iPod Shuffle features a polished steel attachment clip, adopting for the first time the polished steel finishing previously found only on the larger iPods, rather than the brushed aluminum used in the second-generation iPod Shuffle. It also no longer has volume or track controls on the device itself. Instead, the included Apple earphones now include a three-button device on the right earbud cord. This adds the functions of changing between playlists, hearing the song title and artist of the track playing, as well as play/pause, track changes and volume control. It is not possible to change songs or volume with current third-party headphones, since they lack these controls. However, since the iPod Shuffle begins playing music automatically when it is turned on, third-party headphones may still be used in "autoplay" mode (with no volume or playback controls). Some future third-party headphones and headphone adapters will include full support for the iPod Shuffle. In September 2009, Apple introduced three new colors for the iPod Shuffle: pink, blue, and green. The 4GB model is also available in Stainless Steel, exclusively from the Apple Online Store.</string>

			<string>The first Apple II computers went on sale on June 10, 1977 with a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor running at 1 MHz, 4 KB of RAM, an audio cassette interface for loading programs and storing data, and the Integer BASIC programming language built into the ROMs. The video controller displayed 40 columns by 24 lines of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 0x20 to 0x5F) text on the screen, with NTSC composite video output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set by way of a separate RF modulator. The original retail price of the computer was US$1298 (with 4 kB of RAM) and US$2638 (with the maximum 48 kB of RAM). To reflect the computer's character cell color graphics capability, the Apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes, which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. Wozniak's open design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including Apple II peripheral cards such as serial controllers, display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and realtime clocks. Eventually, Apple II accelerator cards were created to double or quadruple the computer's speed. An estimated 40,000 machines were sold during its production run.</string>

			<string>The new MacBook was announced on March 9, 2015 and shipped on April 10, 2015. It has a tapered design similar to that of the MacBook Air and is available in space gray, silver and gold. Other features include a high-resolution Retina Display, a Force Touch trackpad, a redesigned keyboard, and two ports: a headphone/microphone jack and a USB 3.1 Type-C (generation 1, up to 5 Gbit/s) port for charging, data transfer, and video output. Compared to earlier MacBooks, the 2015 model's keys have 17 percent more surface area and its keystrokes 40 percent less depth. The keys use a "butterfly" mechanism that allows for a more stable keystroke than traditional scissor-like mechanisms. The Intel Core M processor does not require a fan, reducing the size of the logic board and allowing the laptop to run silently. The letters on the MacBook's keyboard are set in San Francisco, a typeface designed by Apple in 2014. All previous MacBooks used VAG Rounded.</string>

			<string>The limited edition Mac TV had a bit of an identity crisis. It came in a black LC 520-style case. (It is one of only a few Macs to have ever been black.) It came with a cable-ready TV tuner card, and included a CD-ROM drive. Only 10,000 Mac TVs were made before it was discontinued. However, Its TV-tuner card has become a popular option on many LCs and Performas.</string>

			<string>The Apple II Plus, introduced in June 1979, included the Applesoft BASIC programming language in ROM. This Microsoft-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade, supported floating-point arithmetic, and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple II series. It shipped with 16 KB, 32 KB or 48 KB of main RAM, expandable to 64 KB by means of the Language Card, an expansion card that could be installed in the computer's slot 0. The Apple's 6502 microprocessor could support a maximum of 64 KB of address space, and a machine with 48KB RAM reached this limit because of the additional 12 KB of read-only memory and 4 KB of I/O addresses. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. Like the Apple II, the Apple II Plus had no lowercase functionality. All letters from the keyboard were upper-case, there was no caps lock key, and there were no lowercase letters in the text-mode font stored in the computer's ROM.</string>

			<string>By mid-1984, Apple's commitment to bringing the mouse to its entire product line resulted in the release of the Apple II Mouse Card. Since this was a dedicated mouse port, Apple simply re-packaged the Macintosh mouse, but with the same creamy-beige cable and connector used on the IIc mouse and bundled it along with special software called MousePaint for use with the Apple II, II Plus, and IIe computers. Like the original IIc mouse, it used the same model number as the Macintosh. Unlike the Mouse IIc, however, it can be interchanged with the Macintosh version, but cannot be used on the IIc. Due to the popularity of the Macintosh and shortage of mice, Apple later repackaged the original Apple Mouse IIc in this bundle as well since it was cross-platform compatible. The Apple Mouse II and its successors were never included as standard equipment on any computer. By 1986 Apple had updated its product lines with new cable connectors. With the Apple IIe already three years old, the AppleMouse II was re-badged for the IIe alone and essentially used a repackaged Macintosh Mouse with no modifications. Later it would also use the Platinum Macintosh version.</string>

The display features a built-in iSight camera, microphone, and dual speaker system. A MagSafe cable runs from the back of the display for charging notebooks. It is the first Cinema Display to use LED backlighting and the Mini DisplayPort for video input. This display is only officially compatible with Macs that have the Mini DisplayPort connector. A third-party converter must be used in order to use this display with older Macs.</string>

			<string>Announced on the last day of January in 2005, the PowerBook G4 (1.5-1.67 GHz, was essentially a speed-bump of the existing PowerBook G4 line, with modest feature improvements on the low and middle-end models. The PowerBook G4 shipped in five configurations. There were two 12.1" models, both with 1.5 GHz processors and 512 MB of RAM: the Combo Drive model, with a 60 GB hard drive, sold for $1,499 U.S. and the SuperDrive model, with an 80 GB hard drive, sold for $1,699 U.S. There were also two 15.2" models, both with 512 MB of RAM, an 80 GB hard drive and an illuminated keyboard: the 1.5 GHz Combo Drive model was $1,999 U.S.; the SuperDrive model, with a 1.67 GHz processor, was $2,299 U.S. There was a single, high-end 17" model, with 512 MB of RAM, a 100 GB hard drive, twice the VRAM, a dual-link DVI port and a SuperDrive, for $2,699 U.S.</string>

The PowerBook G4 (DL-SD) was available in two configurations: the 15.2" model was $1999 U.S. and the 17.1" model was $2499 U.S. The 12.1" model was not upgraded.</string>

			<string>Housed in an 8x8x8 cube, the Power Mac G4 Cube combined the elegance of the iMac with the power of the PowerMac G4. The Cube traded expandability for its diminutive size: There were no PCI slots, and while the graphics card was installed into an 2x AGP slot, there wasn't room for full-length AGP cards. With the exception of PCI expansion, the Cube was as versatile as it's larger G4 cousin: Three RAM slots, an AirPort card slot, and two USB and FireWire ports. The Cube shipped to retail markets with a 450 MHz G4 processor, a 20 GB hard drive, a 56 kbps modem, 64 MB of RAM, and Apple s Pro Mouse, for $1799 U.S. Another configuration was available through the Apple Store, with a 500 MHz G4, a 30 GB hard drive and 128 MB of RAM, for $2299 U.S. Gigabit Ethernet was available as a BTO option. The Cube was not nearly the success that Apple had hoped it would be. The consensus was that Apple had misjudged the market, making the Cube an expensive "luxury" computer instead of a cheaper monitor-less iMac. In February 2001, The Cube received a feature and price change. The low-end configuration was repriced at $1299 U.S. A "better" configuration was made available, with a CD-RW drive and 128 MB of RAM, for $1599 U.S. Finally, the high-end version got a 60 GB hard drive, 256 MB of RAM, a CD-RW drive and an 32 MB NVIDIA GeForce2 MX video card, and sold for $2199 U.S.</string>

			<string>The MacBook Pro was the first portable Mac to use Intel processors. The name for Apple's professional portable was ostensibly changed from PowerBook because Apple felt that all Macintoshes should have "Mac" in their product names. Though the MacBook Pro included a number of enhancements to the final iteration of the PowerBook G4—a thinner case, a built-in iSight camera, a remote control with Apple's Front Row home media center software, an ExpressCard/34 slot, improved wireless reception, a larger screen and the new "MagSafe" power connector designed to be less prone to damage—there were also some notable omissions. The MacBook Pro no longer included FireWire800, s-video or modem ports (a USB modem was available separately), and the slot-loading SuperDrive no longer supported dual-layer DVD+R media. The MacBook Pro shipped in two configurations: 1.83 GHz/80 GB/$1999 U.S. and 2.0 GHz/100 GB/$2499 U.S. Both configurations were speed-bumped in May 2006 to 2.0 GHz and 2.16 GHz, respectively, and were made available with a glossy screen as a BTO option.</string>

			<string>The iPad 2 is Apple's 2nd generation iPad tablet, announced on March 2, 2011, and released in the United States on March 11, 2011. Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs revealed the device at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on March 2, 2011, despite his medical leave at the time. Alongside the iPad 2, Jobs also announced that the iOS 4.3 operating system would also be available March 9, 2011. The iPad 2 started selling on the Apple website on March 11. Apple introduced a new hardware design for its 2nd generation tablet, making it approximately 33 percent thinner than its predecessor. New standard features include a gyroscope, as well as front and rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video messaging—capable of messaging with iPhone 4, iPod Touch 4, and Mac OS X Snow Leopard devices. The iPad 2 also features an upgraded processor, a dual core Apple A5, which Apple claims is twice as fast as its predecessor for CPU operations, and up to 9 times as fast for GPU operations. In spite of a thinner design and more powerful processor, Apple claims to have retained the previous generation's advertised 10 hour battery life for the iPad 2. In addition to WiFi-only and AT&amp;T cellular data models available with 16, 32 and 64 GB of internal storage, the iPad 2 introduces a third tier of model with CDMA support for Verizon Wireless in the United States, available separately from the AT&amp;T capable version. With the option of white or black trim for all aforementioned models, this brings the total number of available models to 18, up from 6 for the previous generation. Apple also unveiled the Smart Cover, an accessory that attaches magnetically to the side of the device and protects the front of the device. Alongside the iPad 2, Jobs also announced that the iOS 4.3 operating system would be available March 11, 2011.</string>

Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed the device at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on March 7, 2012. The new iPad has a lithium-ion polymer battery that lasts up to 10 hours; an Apple A5X dual-core CPU; a quad-core graphics processor; a 5-megapixel, rear-facing camera capable of 1080p video recording; and a VGA front-facing videophone camera designed for FaceTime. The display resolution is 2048×1536 (QXGA) with 3.1 million pixels—four times more pixels than the iPad 2. The new iPad however is slightly thicker than its older sibling by 0.8 mm and is heavier by 51 grams for the Wi-Fi model (652 grams).</string>

			<string>The PowerMac G4 (Digital Audio) was the first speed increase for the PowerMac line in over a year. The G4 (Digital Audio) was so-named because of a new built-in amplifier, designed to drive USB speakers, along with the conventional minijack line output. The G4 (DA) included a number of architectural improvements, including a 133 MHz bus, 4 PCI slots, and a 1 GB/s main-memory bus. PCI throughput was enhanced by the removal of the PCI bridge (the main memory controller now communicated directly with the PCI bus). The G4 (DA) shipped with two new flavors of G4: The low-end models shipped with the PPC 7410 processor, a lower-power variant of the 7400. The higher-end machines shipped with a PPC 7450 processor, which in addition to an on-chip 256 KB L2 Cache, and had four Altivec ("Velocity Engine") units. The PowerMac G4 (DA) shipped in four configurations: The 466 MHz configuration included 128 MB of RAM and 30 GB hard drive, for $1699 U.S. The 533 MHz configuration included 128 MB of RAM and a 40 GB hard drive for $2199 U.S. ($2499 U.S. for the dual-533 model). The 667 MHz configuration included 256 MB of RAM and a 60 GB hard drive for $2799 U.S. Finally, the 733 MHz configuration included 256 MB of RAM, a 60 GB hard drive for $3499 U.S. The 733 MHz came with an innovative new "SuperDrive" which could read and write both CDs and DVDs.</string>

			<string>The 9600 was packaged in an eye-pleasing new tower design, built to make its insides more easily accessible. It ran on 233, 200 or dual 200 MHz 604e's. Although it looked different on the outside, the logic board was basically the same design as that of the 9500. The 9600 was originally priced at $4,700 U.S. for the dual 200 MHz configuration, $4,200 U.S. for the single 233 MHz, and $3,700 U.S. for the single 200 MHz. In August, the 9600 was "speed bumped" with either a 300 or 350 MHz "Mach 5" chip, a new high speed variant on the 604e. The 350 MHz version barely shipped before Apple took it off the market, partially because of the small supply of 350 MHz chips, but mostly because their upcoming PPC 750-based "Gossamer" Macs (the PowerMac G3) would eclipse it both in performance and price. The 350-MHz 9600 returned several months later to fill out the High-End market. While the G3 was in many cases faster, its logic board had only three PCI slots and three RAM slots. With superior expandability, the 9600 was still the high-end choice for many.</string>

			<string>iOS 8 was announced at Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2014 on June 2, 2014, and was released on September 17, 2014. Billed as "The biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the App Store", iOS 8 brings some major new features and user interface enhancements over iOS 7. A new app named Health and a corresponding framework named HealthKit became available with the release. Health allows users to track their steps, oxygen, sleep levels, and other health related data. Additionally, users can enter their medical history. iOS 8 includes a new predictive typing feature called QuickType. It displays word selections above the keyboard as one types. Additionally, iOS 8 will allow users to install third-party keyboards. Handoff allows users to share documents, e-mails, and websites over Wi-Fi or personal hotspot between iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite devices. For example, when working on an email, Pages document, Keynote presentation, Numbers spreadsheet, viewing a location in Maps or browsing Safari on the Mac, on the lock screen of the iOS device it shows what app users are currently using on their Mac and will allow them to pick up where they left off in the app they were using on the Mac. This also works in the other direction. Siri was updated to support hands-free activation and music identification using Shazam. Voice and video messages are automatically deleted unless the user saves them for future reference. Interactive notifications let the user respond to texts without leaving the app they are currently using. Five days after release, iOS 8 had been installed on 46% of Apple devices.</string>

At first, Apple marketing literature did not specify a separate name for the operating system, stating simply that the "iPhone runs OS X". Initially, third-party applications were not supported. Apple indicated that developers could build web applications that "would behave like native apps on the iPhone". On October 17, 2007, Apple announced that a native Software Development Kit (SDK) was under development and that they planned to put it "in developers' hands in February". On March 6, 2008, Apple released the first beta, along with a new name for the operating system: "iPhone OS".</string>

			<string>The original Apple Computer, also known retroactively as the Apple I, or Apple-1, was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only means of transportation, a VW Microbus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California. The Apple I went on sale at a price of US$666.66, because Steve Wozniak "liked repeating digits" and because of a one-third markup on the $500 U.S. wholesale price. About 200 units were produced and all but 25 were sold during nine or ten months. Unlike other hobbyist computers of its day, which were sold as kits, the Apple I was a fully assembled circuit board containing about 60+ chips. However, to make a working computer, users still had to add a case, power supply transformers, power switch, ASCII keyboard, and composite video display. An optional board providing a cassette interface for storage was later released at the cost of $72 U.S. The Apple I's built-in computer terminal circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a keyboard and an inexpensive television set. Competing machines such as the Altair 8800 generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red LEDs, most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a teletypewriter machine. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977 the price was dropped to $475 U.S. It continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the Apple II in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year. Apple dropped the Apple I from its price list by September 1977, officially discontinuing it. As Wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer, the company offered Apple I owners discounts and trade-ins for Apple IIs to persuade them to return their computers.</string>

			<string>Lion Server comes with unlimited client licenses as did Snow Leopard Server. In releasing the developer preview of Mac OS X Lion in February 2011, Apple indicated that beginning with Lion, Mac OS X Server would be bundled with the operating system and would not be marketed as a separate product. However, a few months later, the company said it would instead sell the server components as a $49.99 U.S. add-on to Lion, distributed through the Mac App Store (as well as Lion itself). The combined cost of an upgrade to Lion and the purchase of the Lion Server components, approximately $80 U.S., will nonetheless be significantly lower than the retail cost of Snow Leopard Server ($499 U.S.) Lion Server includes new versions of iCal Server, Wiki Server, and Mail Server. More significantly, Lion Server can be used for iOS mobile device management.</string>

			<string>The Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the Apple IIe, a cost-reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features, such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64 KB of RAM. The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48 KB Apple II Plus with a language card; the machine had no slot 0, but instead had an auxiliary slot that for most practical purposes took the place of slot 3, the most commonly used slot for 80-column cards in the II Plus. The Apple IIe was the most popular Apple II ever built and was widely considered the "workhorse" of the line. It also has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time – it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly 11 years. In that time, following the original, two important variations were introduced known as the Apple IIe Enhanced (four new replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model Apple IIc, including an upgraded processor called the 65C02) and the Apple IIe Platinum (a modernized new look for the case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a built-in numeric keypad). An Enhanced IIe with 128 KB of RAM can be considered the minimum requirement for running most Apple II software released after about 1988. //e models were distinguished from the standard IIe by having 128 KB of memory, DHGR graphics mode, and a 65C02 CPU.

Changes made to the GUI (Graphical User Interface) include the Launchpad (similar to the home screen of iOS devices), auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control, which unifies Exposé, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface. Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed (similar to iOS). In addition to this, documents auto-save by default so users don't have to worry about manually managing their documents.</string>

			<string>The Apple Adjustable Keyboard was introduced in 1993 at a retail price of $219 U.S. The keyboard attached to the computer via the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB). It aimed to solve repetitive stress injuries resulting in carpal tunnel syndrome, after several computer keyboard manufacturers were sued for poor design. The Apple Adjustable Keyboard came with contoured plastic wrist rests, and a separate keypad with function keys and arrow keys. This was the third and last time Apple offered a separate numeric keypad. Unlike its predecessors, it was not sold separately. The keyboard also included volume buttons and a record button on the right side of the keyboard. It was hinged at the top, allowing the user to adjust the angle between the right and left sides of the keyboard. The split came between the key pairs: 5/6, T/Y, G/H, and B/N. The space bar floated midway between the two parts. Although the keyboard addressed several ergonomic problems, it was reviewed poorly due to using a large amount of desk space, mainly because of the optional palm rests.</string>

			<string>Half a year following the release of the Macintosh IIx passed before Apple introduced the Macintosh IIcx in 1989. Despite resembling the IIx to a great extent and providing the same performance, the IIcx was quieter (due to its quieter fan on a smaller power supply) than its predecessor. The design was also made much more compact by reducing the number of NuBus slots from 6 to 3. The new case, Apple's first to be designed to operate in either horizontal or vertical orientation, remained in use for its successors the IIci and Quadra 700. The idea for vertical orientation, one of the first minitower cases, was suggested by Apple CEO John Sculley, who was running out of space on his desk. The model was designated IIcx for compact (echoing the earlier Apple IIc compact model in the Apple II series), and the x was Apple's designation for the 68030 processor. Users liked the Mac IIcx in part because its components and parts (such as RAM, NuBus slots, and power supply) snapped into place inside the case without the need for screws. There was one central safety screw that tied the assembly together though it was often not reinstalled if ever removed. At the IIcx's introduction, Jean-Louis Gassee demonstrated the IIcx's modular design by assembling one from parts in front of the audience. This made it less expensive to build, easier to repair, and earned it heavy praise and a warm reception amongst the Mac community. This model was superseded by the Macintosh IIci which used the same case. The case is unofficially a Snow White design. It could run System 6 and System 7. The case is designed by the Apple Industrial Design Group and though drawing upon the Snow White design language, making the Macintosh IIcx the first of computers that the then-new Apple Industrial Design Group designed. 1989 made it the beginning of the effort to break ties with Frog Design.</string>

			<string>The DuoDock allowed any Duo to immediately expand its features. The DuoDock included a larger hard drive, more VRAM, and more input and output ports. The DuoDock, and its successors, allowed the Duo product line to become office desktop models. The DuoDock was replaced in May 1994 by the DuoDock Plus and the DuoDock II. The DuoDock was costlier, and came with a 68882 FPU standard.</string>

			<string>It was announced and sold for the first time on August 2, 2005, and a Bluetooth version was available from 2006 to 2009. Before the Mighty Mouse, Apple had sold only one-button mouses with its computers, beginning with the Apple Lisa 22 years earlier. On October 20, 2009, the wireless Mighty Mouse was discontinued and replaced by the multi-touch Magic Mouse. The wired version of the device remains available, but was renamed the "Apple Mouse" as of the same date, due to trademark issues with another manufacturer of a device named "Mighty Mouse".</string>

			<string>The Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the Apple IIe, a cost-reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features, such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64 KB of RAM. The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48 KB Apple II Plus with a language card; the machine had no slot 0, but instead had an auxiliary slot that for most practical purposes took the place of slot 3, the most commonly used slot for 80-column cards in the II Plus. The Apple IIe was the most popular Apple II ever built and was widely considered the "workhorse" of the line. It also has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time – it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly 11 years. In that time, following the original, two important variations were introduced known as the Apple IIe Enhanced (four new replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model Apple IIc, including an upgraded processor called the 65C02) and the Apple IIe Platinum (a modernized new look for the case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a built-in numeric keypad). An Enhanced IIe with 128 KB of RAM can be considered the minimum requirement for running most Apple II software released after about 1988. IIe models were distinguished from the standard IIe by having 128 KB of memory, DHGR graphics mode, and a 65C02 CPU.

			<string>Announced in January 2006 alongside the MacBook Pro, the iMac (Core Duo) was the first desktop Mac based on an Intel processor. Running on the Intel Core Duo processor, which had two processor cores on a single chip, the iMac (Core Duo) was significantly faster than its predecessor, the iMac (iSight), when running Intel-compiled code. It also features faster bus and memory speeds, a better graphics chip set, and a mini-DVI port which featured monitor spanning (a first for consumer Macs). It was available in two configurations: the 17" model, with a 1.83 GHz Core Duo processor was $1299 U.S., and the 20" model, running at 2.0 GHz, was $1699 U.S.</string>

			<string>The original StyleWriter was released in 1990. It replaced the dot-matrix ImageWriter printers. The new ink jet technology was very promising due to its good quality and the low price. The StyleWriter series was targeted at consumer users. While StyleWriter was able to print one page per minute, the StyleWriter II doubled that performance. With the release of the Color StyleWriter series, the StyleWriter printers were discontinued.</string>

			<string>Mac OS 9, introduced by Apple on October 23, 1999 is the last version of the "Classic" Macintosh Operating System (Mac OS) released before being succeeded by Mac OS X. Upon introduction, Mac OS 9 was advertised as having "50 new features," including 128-bit encryption capabilities and Sherlock 2. Originally intended to debut as Mac OS 8.7, Mac OS 9 is considered by some the most functional version of the original Mac OS. While Mac OS 9 did not include such modern operating system features such as protected memory and pre-emptive multitasking, lasting improvements include the addition of an automated Software Update engine and support for multiple users. Apple billed Mac OS 9 as "best Internet operating system ever" and heavily marketed its Sherlock 2 software, an improvement over the original Sherlock which extended the tool to many online resources. Sherlock 2 boasted a 'channels' feature for different kinds of searches and a had QuickTime-like metallic appearance. Mac OS 9 also featured integrated support for Apple’s suite of Internet tools then known as iTools (now known as iCloud) and included improved Open Transport networking.</string>

			<string>On July 11, 2008, Apple released the iPhone 3G across twenty-two countries in two storage options, 8 GB and 16 GB. The larger capacity 16 GB model was available in either black or white. The iPhone 3G was internally similar to its predecessor, but included several new hardware features, such as Assisted GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. The device also benefited from software improvements introduced with iPhone OS 2.0, which was launched at the same time. As well as other features (including Push email and turn-by-turn navigation), this new operating system introduced the App Store—Apple's new distribution platform for third-party applications.</string>
